After recent forays into ambient, \"Subversion\" finds Mental Health Consumer reexploring the aggressive, off-kilter, and slightly mysterious sounds from the start of their career, while adding experimental interludes and modern production that are unmistakably MHC.",

            "about": "Nighttime is a source of new perspectives and surprising revelations.\nMental Health Consumer (Brian Ruskin) returns with \"Too Warm to Be This Late, Too Chilled to Feel Secure\", an ambient journey through the late evening and early morning hours to accompany your sleepless activities. Entirely beatless, the album's emphasis is on shifting atmospheres and sensations. Tracks are named simply by the changing hours, so the listener can project their own meanings. The record is the spiritual sequel to 2016's \"Early Spring Midnight Walks With Us\" (released on Archaic Horizon records), another ambient excursion through the evening. In addition to the individual tracks, Mental Health Consumer shares a Continuous Mix that emphasizes the transitions in mood as the hours progress - sometimes subtle and gradual, sometimes reactionary and significant, hopefully, contemplative and inspiring.",

            "about": "Mental Health Consumer's \"Turning Corners\" is an edgy, anxious, and challenging album of experimental-leaning electronic tracks and soundscapes. Taking the listener on an inward journey, the album is autobiographical, inspired by a very specific unfortunate event and its aftermath, but \"Turning Corners\" will resonate for all listeners as they consider the juxtaposition of worries and faith, regrets and hope, melancholy and optimism throughout their own experiences. Remastered and continuously mixed, and employing a unique production style, \"Turning Corners\" will surprise some listeners, though the trademarks of MHC's sounds remain - found sounds, live guitar, skittering beats, field recordings, ambient pads and analog melodies - even if occasionally wandering around darker corners than usual.",
