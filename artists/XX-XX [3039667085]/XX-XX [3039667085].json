            "about": "This album is a journey through light and shadow, a meditation on presence and transcendence. Each track unfolds like a fleeting moment — a prayer, a breath, a memory dissolving into the ether. It invites you to surrender to the sounds, to feel beyond the surface, and to discover the sacred in the everyday.\nSCATTER\nHoly and kind, like warm light shining through glass.\nSo pure it can bring tears to your eyes.\nThis is not just music — it’s a prayer.\nETHER\nA bubble of ether, sunny, light, and playful.\nJoy that follows a spiritual catharsis.\nThe very light that appears after the tears.\nVOID\nA deep guitar riff, echoing into eternity.\nA return to the infinite.\nThis is not the end — it’s the primal source.\nDISSOLVE\nA dawn in the mist,\nlike a drop of water fading into the morning air.\nThe dissolution of self, memories, and physicality — an eastern dream.",

By the 30-minute mark, the texture reaches peak intensity, gently breaking apart inner noise. Then, as it dissolves, you’re left in a field of refined stillness, where perception is unfiltered and crystalline.\nThis piece is not music — it is a tool, a tuning fork for your being, a vibrational temple.\nHeadphones required.\nStillness recommended.\nSkepticism optional.\nAllow it to work. It already is.",

It’s not here to guide or resolve; it’s here to unfold, like a breath caught in the stillness of dusk.\nThe sound drifts like grains of sand spilling through an open hand, each note a fleeting glimpse of something shared: a half-remembered gaze, the warmth of a laugh, the pause before words were spoken. It’s time made audible, not to trap you in the past, but to let you trace its edges.\nCHRONOS doesn’t cling or demand. It moves, soft as light spilling over a horizon, inviting you to release what lingers—not with loss, but with grace.\nHe’s still there. Woven into the waves. Eternal, yet ever-changing.",

            "about": "CRIMSON: The Star in the Void\nWhen the last star fell, it didn’t shatter. It didn’t fade. It became other.\nLight dies slowly, a whisper dissolving into nothingness. It leaves no warmth—only a silhouette, carved from all-consuming dark. This silhouette is no mere shadow. It is a husk, cradling a fading spark, the final trace of a radiance that once tore the heavens.\nThe star knew: light is not eternal. It drowns in the void, swallowed by the black. Yet it did not yield. It gathered its ash, every charred shard, and forged a form. A form of light that no longer burns, yet persists. It became a shadow, striding through the abyss, with a lament that fractures the silence of the void.\nCRIMSON is its voice. Not a cry, not a flare, but a heavy, tar-like murmur seeping through the all-consuming dark. It does not shine to guide. It endures to remember. To whisper: even ash can hold the shape of light.\nThe void listens.\nThis is not pain. It is truth.\nThe shadow does not sink. It moves.\nCRIMSON is the star’s lament, drowning in the dark.",

            "about": "HEX is a dark journey into a world of isolation and corruption, where space itself becomes a prison. In this track, the lord of darkness watches over the endless running of souls inside a cube from which there is no escape. Life here is an eternal confinement, and every step is taken with immense effort. The deep bass and gloomy synthesizers create a sense of unbearable pressure, while the gradually intensifying soundscape emphasizes the hopelessness of the situation.The track explores themes of control, captivity, and absolute power, where every moment is a fight for freedom, but there is no freedoom, no escape......",

                    "about": "HEX is a dark journey into a world of isolation and corruption, where space itself becomes a prison. In this track, the lord of darkness watches over the endless running of souls inside a cube from which there is no escape. Life here is an eternal confinement, and every step is taken with immense effort. The deep bass and gloomy synthesizers create a sense of unbearable pressure, while the gradually intensifying soundscape emphasizes the hopelessness of the situation.The track explores themes of control, captivity, and absolute power, where every moment is a fight for freedom, but there is no freedoom, no escape......",

Each layer shifts gently in space, like sunlight refracting through cold air.\n—\nDelta (2.5 Hz) – Levitation in meditative stillness\n→ 100 Hz (L) / 102.5 Hz (R)\nA low, almost inaudible pulse — like breath beneath a frozen lake.\nTheta (6.5 Hz) – Light trance and inner vision\n→ 160 Hz (L) / 166.5 Hz (R)\nFlickers of dreaming, as if watching light dance through a glass lens.\nAlpha (9 Hz) – Steady, lucid awareness\n→ 300 Hz (L) / 309 Hz (R)\nA balanced stream of air and silence — effortless flight.\nGamma (40 Hz) – Crystal clarity of consciousness\n→ 450 Hz (L) / 490 Hz (R)\nA thin shimmer, like the glint of ice in sunlight — the vibration of presence.\n—\nNot a thing to listen to — a place to vanish into.\nClose your eyes.

Each set serves a distinct purpose, guiding the listener through layered states of awareness:\nDelta (3 Hz) – recovery and letting go\n100 Hz ( / 103 Hz\nA grounding entry point that evokes deep restorative states, similar to dreamless sleep. A sonic base for surrender.\nTheta (6 Hz) – imagery and subconscious flow\n200 Hz / 206 Hz\nGentle immersion into inner visions and intuitive currents. A realm of symbols and subtle emotional movement.\nAlpha (8 Hz) – balance and presence\n400 Hz / 408 Hz\nA mid-range zone of calm alertness. The mind relaxes, yet stays aware — like a clear sky after rain.\nGamma (38 Hz) – clarity and integration\n500 Hz / 538 Hz\nA final convergence. These frequencies consolidate the experience, allowing insight and coherence to surface.\nSTILL VECTOR is not meant for distraction —\nbut for deep tuning.\nNot for the mind —\nbut for everything else.",

Only the path — slow, solitary, inevitable. And a silence that is not empty, but heavy with the weight of what once was. This is not music that leads, but one that walks beside you — like breath echoing through a world too tired to speak.\nLet it follow you, if you dare to walk without asking where.",

It evokes an inner sense of radiance, tuning the listener into calmness, faith, and an uplifting lightness. Unlike darker or melancholic ambient compositions, “Yellow” is filled with warmth, gentle drive, and the feeling of something greater moving through the sound.\nThis track is about embracing one’s own imperfection, about the personal journey, and about the light that can always be found within. Its sound opens space for hope, love, and inner peace — without words, only through a clean, vibrant resonance that helps you feel truly alive.\nThe music in “Yellow” unfolds softly, like morning sunlight, filling the listener with a quiet confidence. It becomes a soundtrack for reset, meditation, inspiration, creativity, and forward motion.",
