            "about": "\"all memories fade in time\" marks a double celebration for me.\nNot only is it my 200th Bandcamp release, but 30th May is also the 4th anniversary since I first pressed \"publish album\" and started sharing my music on an unsuspecting world.\nI have enjoyed every minute of the journey so far, and long may it continue. Here's to the next four years and beyond!\nI would like to thank everyone who has supported me by listening to, buying and downloading my music over the past few years. I hope you continue to join me on this voyage and see where we end up.\nAs always, I would recommend listening to my music with headphones at a low to medium volume and just let your mind wander.\nAll the best\nBen\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nTracks recorded and mixed May 2024\nCover artwork © B.Beadle original photograph taken Yosemite National Park, California USA February 2014",

Thank you for the short time you were in our lives. You made us so happy and you touched the lives of all you met.\nWe will never forget you xxx\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nRecorded July 2021\nCover photograph © K.Beadle used with permission.

            "about": "I had lots of tracks that needed tidying up and finishing off and when I counted them up at the end of November, there were 23 releases ready to go. It then dawned on me, with one more release, I would be able to create my own musical Advent calendar.\n\"in the realm of the ocean forests \" brings to a close my celebration of Advent. I hope you have enjoyed listening to all of the music I have released this month.\nI would like to thank all of my followers both old and new. I really do appreciate your continuing support and the fact that you take time out of your busy lives to listen to the music I make.\nI still enjoy making music and I have no plans to stop anytime soon. I plan to take a little rest over the festive break, and I will be back in 2025.\nFor now, I would like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and all the best for the coming New Year.\nBest wishes\nBen (aka Laudanum, for what ails you)\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nTracks recorded and mixed December 2024\nCover artwork © B.Beadle 2024 original photograph taken Chatham, Kent December 2024",

            "about": "\"Nights In The City\" marks my 100th release on Bandcamp.\nI wanted to make something more 'lively' to celebrate the occasion and these tracks are a mixed bag of sounds and styles, which I believe, meet the brief!\nOn the whole, this is a positive and upbeat album which reminds me of the many great nights I've had in cities (also towns, villages and hamlets) around the world. When I remember those nights, I often picture them as scenes from a movie and now I have soundtracks for them.\nI did most of my growing up in the 80s and 90s and these tracks owe a huge debt to the music, film and TV of those times. 'Questing Nights' would not sound out of place in an 80s, low-budget sword and sorcery flick, which truth be told, I would probably still watch now!\nToday is officially the start of British Summer Time. I hope these tracks accompany you through the coming summer on those long, hot and sometimes sticky \"Nights In The City.\"\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nRecorded January 2022 tinkered with February/March 2022\nCover photograph © B.Beadle taken Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois, USA September 2018\nFor Mary, the best \"human\" mum in the world and for Katie, the best \"dog\" mum in the world - Happy Mother's Day xxx\nI would recommend listening to the album with headphones at a medium volume.",

It really felt like winter had arrived.\nI don't know if it was the cold that influenced the sound of these tracks but they all have a touch of melancholy about them. It just didn't seem right releasing them during the carefree days of summer, so I've waited until now.\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nRecorded June 2021 tinkered with slightly December 2021\nCover photograph © B.Beadle Taken Cuckmere Haven, East Sussex September 2020",

It's taken me nearly 45 years to find a creative outlet which I enjoy doing, and which gives me so much pleasure. As I have a lot of lost time to make up for, I don't intend to stop anytime soon!\nI would like to thank everyone who has supported me by listening to, buying and downloading my music over the past year. I need to give a special mention to my wife, Katie, as she hasn't minded me sneaking off to my studio, on numerous occasions, when I really should have been doing something else.\nHere's to many more years of messing around with sound!!\nCheers\nLaudanum, for what ails you (aka Ben)",

Being surrounded by hoodoos, spires and colourful rock formations gives it a sense of being otherworldly, almost dreamlike.\nThese tracks are inspired by those visits and named after some of the famous features within the park.\nI hope you enjoy listening to them and as always, I would recommend wearing headphones and listening to them at a low to medium volume.\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nRecorded July/August 2021\nCover photograph © B.Beadle Taken Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA September 2019",

We watched bad ones, mediocre ones and some down right fantastic ones.\nThis piece of music stirred something in my memories and now when I listen to it, I imagine the unending chases and the stark and beautiful landscapes rolling by.\nThere is also a sense of unease in the music that fits with the sudden outbursts of violence contained in many westerns, and the fear of what awaits the protagonist on their journey.\nMost of all though, it reminds me of happier times. Sat with my Dad, watching westerns and loving every minute of it.\nHappy 83rd birthday Dad. It would be so much nicer to be able to say that to you in person, but I'm sure you are listening somewhere.\nWe miss you xxx\nAll compositions Laudanum, for what ails you\nRecorded and mixed July 2022\nCover artwork © B.Beadle original photograph taken Scenic Route 12, Utah, USA September 2019",
