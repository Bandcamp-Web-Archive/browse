Originally meant as a kind of gentler B-sides sister EP to \"Warden-against\", these are the last very-WIP bounces of the tracks I was working on before the mishap, which I managed to salvage from my phone storage where I had sent them to test-listen. I hope you enjoy this unexpected and unfinished mini-release.",

            "about": "Not explicitly a concept album, \"Hilcomparatee\" attempts to vignette an ambiguous vista into the eponymous world of the eponymous character: a troubled, neo-Byronic personality; hereditary king over rain and whither he issues it; drunk on Elixir of which he'd heard haughty history hailed; mentee of the one who Looked Like a Kid but now rests in an awfully ornamental Mound; sustained solely by the constant grief he has for himself and the time he kills and by the unambiguous, brown leer of the soul-smashing Eyes—accompanied only by that insane Mouth—seemingly always round the corner.\n---\nUnreal instruments, high-friction sound-walls, urgent late-night confessions and audio footage of some world now long lost in-between—all these serve to paint the picture of an invisibly bounded, fantastical universe in which everything is painfully just.",
