            "about": "The first collaborative release from Brooklyn-based DIY outfit Sorry Records and Chicago-via-Detroit co-operative label EAT DIS, Tony G presents One More Time — four powerhouse techno tracks full of hypnotizing gnarly wormhole techno spiral that comes complete with a nearly 170bpm Miami Bass fever dream electro remix from DJ Girl (Planet Euphorique, EAT DIS) and an arresting hard drum take from Taipei experimental club luminary Sonia Calico.\nThe third release of the year from Rochester-born/NYC-based producer/dj Tony G, One More Time is Tony’s evil hangover post last March’s gospel house piano explosion Pianoman EP with Philly ballroom genius DJ Delish and west coast rave queen Bored Lord. Drawing inspiration from bleary NYC raves of a pre-COVID past as well as a particularly transcendent Wata Igarashi live set at Sustain-Release Year Six, One More Time is a testament to Tony’s craft-filled, genre-hopping talent. Previously praised by as “one of a few young New York producers doing new things with classic house (Resident Advisor),\" One More Time finds Tony taking on classic techno, past and present, with precision and glee.\nPremieres via Inverted Audio, Bizaar Bazaar, Crude Berlin, & Motz.",

            "about": "THE LOST MECHA TOOLS is Atlanta producer and EAT DIS core member Twofold’s hardest-hitting release yet, a scorched blast of robotic club tracks that further define the new “mecha” genre the artist has helped pioneer alongside originators Zvrra and Tank Jr. These three songs show Twofold at their best, firing on all cylinders in the signature style that’s caught the attention of both Bandcamp Daily and dance music obsessives across the globe; from the floor-filling, tom-heavy groove of “DRUMLINE MECH” to the whirring factory hums of “Like Clockwork,” THE LOST MECHA TOOLS stakes its claim as a pivotal touchstone of a sound that’s primed to overtake the world stage. The compilation also features remixes and original mecha tracks from a who’s-who of EAT DIS label heavyweights including Secat, Zvrra, regresssion, and the mysterious Riteskeeper, whose RITESKEEPER I EP served as the first documented mecha release. From start to finish, THE LOST MECHA TOOLS overflows with metallic precision and raw club energy: it’s sure to be an essential release of 2022.",

            "about": "200 years after the First Invocation, the Riteskeeper has returned to us in this age of declining empires and chaos to usher in the Rites of the New Era. All that is old now rots and collapses around us, trapping us beneath the rubble of the Old Era where we suffocate on the fumes of decay. The sound and violence of the first Rites from two centuries ago has faded. Now, time has come for them to be reinvigorated.\nOnly through the efforts of Zvrra, Tank Jr, Twofold, and the rest of Eat Dis crew was a sound hard enough to act as catalyst of the Rites discovered, Mecha. The sounds of machinery are effortlessly turned into instruments of battle on \"Haunted\", servos whirring under blankets of mechanical distortion that never let up energy.\n\"Bad Vibes\" creates of a sense of space and oppression as creaks and sirens echo into a dark void.\n\"Please Stop Killing Me\" elevates the dark sound to cruel and bloody levels, clanging machinery senselessly and efficiently committing acts of audible cruelty.\nDJ Girl and DJ Magongalo join the Riteskeeper in this first outing, turning the unstable chaos of the opening track \"Expert Boymoder\" into a sound befitting the Eat Dis label.\nThe first phase of the Riteskeepers duties has begun.",

            "about": "The EAT DIS collective comes together again for \"THE OTHERSIDE\", an eclectic mix of weirdcore bangers (and anti-bangers) that could only come from the minds of the internet's most Online producers. Genre doesn't matter as much as taking the listener on a strange, maybe too familiar trip through the outsider realms of club music.\n\"Xioucin's Final Retali\" by nohighs & Elevation offer us hallucinations of footwork, breakcore, and maybe something else. Rei Low and twofold let toms, the sounds of mecha and Jersey club reign with \"Surskit\", along with DJ Girl's aptly titled \"Prarie Mecha\".\nSecat takes us into truly hallucinatory territory with the formless \"UNTITLEDFLAME\", while SULFFFFFFUR reminds us of our liminal pasts with \"SAVE ME FROM THE HAZE\". THE OTHERSIDE is full of grooves and secrets.\nLegendary producers Sepha, Zvrra, ODAE, x.nte, Secat, nohighs, elevation, SULFFFFFFUR, Rei Low, Nondi, DJ MAGONGALO, and Ladyroxoxo come together in a way that could only be brought to you by EAT DIS... don't sleep.",

            "about": "WEAPONS is the long awaited collab between producers DJ GIRL and DJ FLP. FREEKBEAT's bass will piss your neighbors off and the drums will get your feet moving recklessly. OPERATOR bounces around with tasty breaks, with a breezy bright demoscene mix and old skool dub mix. EMERGENCY is a powerful electro banger painting an image of the severity of the current racial and political situation in the US.\nSpeech on emergency by Tamika Mallory\nMore on Tamika:  womensmarch.com/national-team/2019/1/17/tamika-mallory\nnbmbaa.org/tamika-mallory/\nA portion of the proceeds will go to Chicago Community Bond Fund:  chicagobond.org",
