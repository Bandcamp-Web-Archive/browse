            "about": "\"A Year In Minutes\" is an audio calendar/artistic diary which contains a sound recording, a geographical location, and a photograph, artwork, or essay for each day of the year of 2024. The collection is meant as an exploration of psycho-geography—the study of the influence of geographical environment on the mind or behaviour—but also something of a window into the creative process and artistic inspiration.\nThe musical entries—recorded daily and entirely independently from the pre- and proceeding entries—range from spontaneous compositions to field recordings to found sounds meant to be heard both as incidental \"noise\" and/or fragmentary songs.\nThe physical edition of the book is available to pre-order directly from Adventurous Music here:\nadventurousmusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-year-in-minutes\nwww.adventurousmusic.com\nThere will be a digital (pdf) version of the book available upon the September release date, as well as the 365 minutes of the soundtrack. The audio for the first month of January is now streaming as a sample.",

Each \"triptych\" is based around a simple, slow-moving melodic line, which repeats three times with the addition of a harmonic line upon each repetition, culminating in a three part harmony.
