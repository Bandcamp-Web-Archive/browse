            "about": "This complete download version of ALL CLOSED DOORS contains the original 2003 mix of the album, an enhanced 2011 mix and 3 bonus tracks.\nBonus tracks SPECKTRAL I, II and III were recorded at the same time as ALL CLOSED DOORS.\nThe enhanced 2011 mix is remastered and has been adapted into a binaural mix. The result of the binaural mix should spatially transcend normal stereo, since it can accurately reproduce the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in sound waves. Binaural recordings can convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead or above. Any set of headphones that provide good right and left channel isolation are sufficient to hear the immersive effects of the recording and anyone who has even a cheap set of headphones can enjoy these recordings.\nFor optimum listening experience in ‘3D’ you must use headphones. To enhance this listening experience it is recommended that you play back the enhanced mix in a dark room, eyes closed and with no exterior distractions.\n2003 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nBrainwashed\nThe art of the sound collage and drone music has a group of key members. Mirror, Christoph Heemann, Andrew Chalk, William Basinski, and perhaps just a few more are known and loved and create music that invokes images from other worlds; be those images frightening, sublime, or esoteric, it is impossible to deny their visceral impact. Andrew Liles has been added to that list of elusive and wonderful musicians with this release. From the first moment All Closed Doors submerges me into a universe I'm unfamiliar with and perhaps slightly scared of. Furniture drifts through the air, children laugh and disappear down long hallways, shadows scream and laugh at each other when there is nothing to cast them, and the echo of something ancient pours down over me in the form of a vacant sky. The impact of Liles' sound worlds on this disc is unavoidable, his imaginative and spectral cadences whisper and glide through the air in ways that effect the brain; scary stories are told without the aid of a voice, heaven spills over from the speakers into the room even though such a thing is unthinkable. There's a strange light that bounces and reflects off of everything in this world; there are oceans of singing fish and mountains bellowing their hate onto the helpless below. I can't stop coming up with images, it's as if my mind is flooded with an invisible light that forces it into overdrive, into a creative process that can't stop, that wouldn't stop if the album didn't end. Very rarely do I find an album so immediate and compelling as this; I often have butterflies while listening to it. It is perhaps the equivalent of a sexual release extended over fifty minutes of sound. None of the overtly sexual material from Liles' Aural Anagram/Anal Aura Gram is here, but there's that mysterious and ancient something looming over the whole of this release. It's a tension that can't be avoided, a physical tension created in the presence of an erotic and secretive resonance. - Lucas Schleicher  www.brainwashed.com",

            "about": "In what appears to becoming a yearly tradition, I have released yet another free download that coincides with my birthday.\nThis year's edition is a return to paying homage to the debut album by The Sisters of Mercy, an album and a band that I have cited as being a significant influence, without whom I probably wouldn’t have started making music. I have subtly or explicitly paraphrased, referenced and alluded to them throughout many of my recordings.\nFirst and Last and Always is 40 years old, released 11th March 1985 on my 16th birthday.\nHere are four abstract interpretations of the title track. Eagle eared listeners might figure out that the music is actually First and Last and Always with the notation reversed. It is essentially the song played backwards.\nEach song is 10 minutes long with a total running time of 40 minutes, representing the 40 years since the release of the album.\nI recently had the good fortune of meeting Gary Marx, founding member and original guitarist with the Sisters. The image used for this release is his iconic 'Anaconda' guitar, a photo which I took when we met.\nFurther Sisters related homages and articles by myself can be found here -\n30 MINUTES OF THIS CORROSION CORRODED FOR 30 YEARS\nwww.mixcloud.com/andrewowenliles/30-minutes-of-this-corrosion-corroding-for-30-years/\nTHE 20 BEST SONGS BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY AS CHOSEN BY FORMER MEMBERS, COLLABORATORS & MORE\nwww.loudersound.com/features/the-20-best-sisters-of-mercy-songs\nFIRST MONSTER\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/first-monster-last-monster-always-monster/\nMARCH 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "In AMBIDEXTROUS CONSTELLATION Liles and RvH sketch a world, seemingly flat, in which the positions on either side of a gun are interchangeable and the gun itself becomes an inanimate object, a cold functional tool designed to do a specific task without consideration of its real world consequences. A machine without morality or judgement.\nFor this radio play Liles and RvH camped out for a week in the WORM SOUND STUDIOS in Rotterdam and embarked on a British-Dutch standoff, using every machine in the house.\nAssisted by Ash Kilmartin, who narrated throughout, they created a radio play using lists of gun specifications and transcripts of experiences of gunshot victims.",

I’ve got a lovely bunch of coconuts  Every ball you throw will make me rich  There stands my wife, the idol of me life  Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (all together now).... Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch (harmony)  Roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch  Roll a bowl a ball, roll a bowl a ball  Singing roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch",

There is also in existence an alternative take with more sounds, instrumentation and narration.\nThis title may or may not form part of a new Nurse With Wound 'song' or solo Andrew Liles piece, it could also be abandoned, remixed or adapted into something completely different.\nFor now we have this ambiguous 'seed' that may or may not be germinated.",

                    "lyrics": "When an appliance is faulty we quickly replace it with a new one. Sometimes the remedy is quite small and simple. Here is how to repair it yourself. First unplug the appliance and plug another appliance into the socket to check if there is power coming through. If the power is fine, check the plug connections. Check the flex cord for wear or damage. If the appliance has a fuse in the circuit, you should also check to see if that is sound. If all these aspects are fine, then the fault is somewhere else. Check around the appliance for any burned areas. Note if there is a burned 'electric' smell. If the damaged component can be replaced then replace it. If you are unable to do it, take the appliance in for repair. If you are able to do the repairs yourself. Identify and write down the model and year of the of the appliance. Also write down the code and any other details that you may require for purchasing a replacement component. Once you have bought the replacement part make sure that it is the correct one and that it is compatible. When you remove the faulty part, remove the connections one at a time. Label each one as you go. Remember to simultaneously mark the connection points on the faulty appliance. Now connect the replacement. Match the connections of the faulty part to the replacement part. This should not be difficult as you have already marked them. Double check all your connections. Plug the appliance in and switch it on. If it comes on and you do not get any 'electric' smell, you can assume that your repairs are fine and you can use the appliance normally.",

The listener is asked to use and interact with this piece of sound in a vegetative way. It is not listening music (unless you want it to be).\nRecommended listening is at a low volume whilst occupied in doing nothing, starring into space, reading a book, daydreaming, doing the washing up, fixing broken objects, exercising, drawing, painting, thinking, sleeping or bathing. The object of this exercise is to be preoccupied by doing something else other than listening to the music. The sounds should not be digested but gently absorbed. Effectively you should only notice the music once it has stopped.... then replay.",

            "about": "This download version of AN UN WORLD contains the original 2001 mix of the album and an enhanced 2011 mix.\nThe enhanced 2011 mix is remastered and has been adapted into a binaural mix. The result of the binaural mix should spatially transcend normal stereo, since it can accurately reproduce the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in sound waves. Binaural recordings can convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead or above. Any set of headphones that provide good right and left channel isolation are sufficient to hear the immersive effects of the recording and anyone who has even a cheap set of headphones can enjoy these recordings.\nFor optimum listening experience in ‘3D’ you must use headphones. To enhance this listening experience it is recommended that you play back the enhanced mix in a dark room, eyes closed and with no exterior distractions.\n2001 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nAll Music Guide\nAndrew Liles offers little hope or joy on his meticulously crafted album An Un World. Over the course of 14 tracks comprised of various sound sources tweaked into dark ambient soundscapes, the producer carries you through an often fantastic, sometimes frightening world of sound, characterized by its tone more than its individual components. Every song features its own unique palette of sounds. For example, indecipherable voices murmur beneath a haunting wind-like buzz on \"Over Before It Began,\" and a locked-groove piano record loops infinitely beneath a hushed monsoon of rain-like static on the title track. Just as the album comes to a calm yet harrowing close, \"Left Behind\" lumbers on for over 13 minutes, carried along by ghostly ambient tones that waver slightly and seem somehow natural, in an otherworldly kind of way. It's a truly disquieting epic that summarizes the tone of this album more than any other song here. The fact that it lumbers on and on only confirms its haunting quality and, in a way, brings An Un World to a fitting conclusion. Such wonderfully dreary music obviously isn't intended for the masses, but taken for what it is, Liles' work here continually startles you, both with its hushed subtlety and psychological effect. - Jason Birchmeier",

This idea was later abandoned. These 2 tracks are the unreleased L.P. mixes which are less developed versions of what would become the final CD mix.\nA kangaroo consulting the Kabbalah? The monkey as Magus? An occult ocelot? All presided over by the reincarnated grand illuminatus that is and was Johnny Morris? It can only be ANIMAL MAGICK.\n2016 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "My adoration for The Sisters of Mercy has been well documented, I was obsessed with them in my teenage years, this extended to the splinter groups that formed post 1985, after the demise of the 'classic' line up of The Sisters.\nOne of the bands that formed from the ashes of The Sisters was Ghost Dance. I religiously followed their live shows from their earliest incarnation, up to their untimely end in 1989.\nClose to 40 years later, I happened to be introduced to John Grant, the drummer for Ghost Dance. I, of course, badgered and squeezed him up to the point of bullying for stories of yesteryear and yarns of his time in Ghost Dance. We became friends and latterly he introduced me to Richard Steel, the guitarist of Ghost Dance. One fairly intoxicated evening I proposed making a song together, and subsequently, this project was born.\nMy sometimes surreal life in music has taken me to some strange headspaces with random and bizarre coincidences and chance meetings with fellow troubadours. Fellow creative souls, who were part of my introduction, passion and formative education into music, have somehow, magically, become part of my later life.\nThis release is one of those unlikely alignments of the stars, that has, for me, in some inexplicable way, joined many dots and completed another significant circle in my personal 'conceptual continuity'.\nFEBRUARY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "This album was originally released in 2008 as a CDR, it was remastered 2011 and includes the bonus track ‘Burnt’ which appeared on the ‘2008 Brainwaves’ compilation.\nREVIEWS FOR 'BURN' and 'TORCH SONGS'\nVITAL WEEKLY\nSilence, please: drone meisters at work. Not the most unknown, or maybe even the superstars of the lot. Jonathan Coleclough has built a fine oeuvre of work, in which the collaborations with others plays an important role. Andrew Liles is these days a member of Nurse With Wound and travels around now that the Nurses are a live act. Still he finds time to create many, many solo works, such as a twelve CD series for Beta Lactam-ring. And to work with Jonathan Coleclough. The cover suggests that the works were recorded in concert, but perhaps not. Liles' characteristic synthesizer and reverb are present, and Coleclough brings in the use of contact microphones, field recordings and computer manipulation. Careful drone material, that doesn't just swell on a bunch of deep end bass drones (listening to the sea again, as a friend of mine once called this), but there is more happening than just that. Water sounds, clay pots and such like are being used, which especially on side D gives a surprising piece. It was perhaps only last week when I wrote: \"drone, where to now?\" and perhaps as such this is not the way out, but it's surely a great work. And like with so many of Die Stadt releases, the first few copies come with a CD, here a solo one by Coleclough. It starts out not unlike the collaboration with a few isolated sounds, which feed of eventually through some sounds effects or computer programming. A bit more austere and less dense than the 2LP set, but certainly a great concert. Clocking at twenty-six minutes, this also has the perfect length for a good concert.\nTOKAFI\nArtists usually placed in the “Torch Song” tradition include Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Edith Piaf and – if you’re looking for some slighly more contemporary examples - Morrissey and Elvis Costello. This must be the first time, then, that two artist from the drone sector have decided to add their compositions about unrequited love and the desire to possess what can never be one’s own to the long list of standards. What seems like a contradiction in terms at the outset has turned into an almost sacral collection of – well not songs, but something of the sort anyway.\nWhile some not too obvious collaborations yield interesting results despite their inner tensions, this one works because the styles of Jonathan Coleclough and Andrew Liles, regardless of how different and idiosyncratic in their own right they may be, virtually screamed for a symbiosis. On the one hand you have Coleclough, who has only last year celebrated his tenth aniversary as a recording artist with a total of 15 releases and created a niche of his own with a music which originates in the quotidian and subliminates into something alltogether out of the ordinary: The bonus disc to this double LP of two heavy 180g Vinyl records sees him in live action at the “Intergration 3” festival, a concert which incidentally also forms the backbone to some of the tracks to be found here, and documents how he starts with the sounds of various outwardly unspectacular objects and slowly changes their timbre and functionality in a process which takes them into a mysterious yet never depressive space. Liles, on the other hand, has been one of those artists who have allowed multiple influences to penetrate the texture of his highly atmospheric pieces, making him almost unpredictable and lending his work an air of excitment. For “Torch Songs”, he concentrates on the deep sonorities, the physical frequencies and the parts of the spectrum where everything becomes opaque, blurry and intellectually intangible. His drones are either subliminally massive or so evanescent as to appear almost weightless and disturbingly fog-like: They will give way if you walk through them, but there are dangers lurking with each step. Coleclough’s very direct object treatments contrast with these meditative fields in a hypnotic fashion, focussing the listener’s attention while the impending pulsations do their job in feverishly massaging the unconscious. The element of water appears again and again as a sort of guideline, seperating segments of almost absolute vacuum from each other and mellowing the atmosphere, when the intensity reaches its climax. But at the end it is only incomprehendible whispers that remain, rowing the boat across the Styx into the night.\nThere are no lyrics on any of these songs and even the poem by Geoff Sawers printed on the front, back and inner sleeve of this luxurious gateway cover offers no direct link to the aforementioned tradition. So what makes these pieces qualify as love songs nevertheless? By their very obsession with the unattainable, with places one can not inhabit and material things one can not touch, they, too, are filled with an insatiable longing, which knows no hope for fulfillment. It is dark, it is cold and no one is going to carry that torch for you. That is what this record is about and that is something Billy Holiday could have related to in her most desperate hours. By Tobias Fischer\nPARIS TRANSATLANTIC\nThe highly anticipated pairing of Coleclough and Liles, two among the most bright-minded dispensers of unusual sounds from England, had already caused my mental bells to ring out joyously in advance. Geoff Sawers' poem \"I dreamt I was a river\" is painted on the white cover of a double LP that, in its special 250-copy limited edition, also contains a CD EP featuring about 25 minutes of Coleclough's original set at Preston's Intergration 3, where the two protagonists first met in 2004. Liles (a prolific musician if ever there was one, with an average of an album per month these days, not including his collaborations with the likes of Nurse With Wound and Darren Tate) took the recording of Coleclough's performance home and proceeded to \"add, subtract, multiply and divide\" additional source sounds provided by his latest collaborator. Each of the eight soundscapes on Torch Songs finds the perfect spot for every sound to exist and be accepted in that grey area where uneven energies try to work our knowledge into forgetting conventional codes and meanings. Elements of pulse are not totally absent in the manipulation of sound objects, location recordings and drones, each \"torch song\" analyzing them exhaustively, combining manifestations of real activity (including the wonderful voices of Nature) with a cathartic, profane consciousness of something that no religion or philosophy will ever be able to explain. The overall sense is one of solitary awareness, and it feels great. Torch Songs is a minor classic, and I look forward to a swift CD reissue (it often happens with Die Stadt) to save us from having to get up and change sides, and dispense with occasional distortions that appear during the most charged surges.–MR\nTHE WIRE\nBased on live and studio pieces produced by drone alchemist Coleclough, Torch Songs features long stretches of music that are as exquisitely tactile as you would expect, but with subtly roughed up snags and edges that one presumes result from the input of current Nurse With Wound member Liles.\nHer [!] micro-gestures serve to ground Coleclough's gauzy textures and save the whole thing from becoming just too perfect. The springy beats that materialise on side four have that same delightful incongruity that Liles's Nurse With Wound boss Steven Stapleton is such a master of, albeit it with a tad less slapstick involved. By Keith Moline\nAQUARIUS RECORDS\nMuch like the entire back catalogue of John Duncan, British avant-drone artist Jonathan Coleclough has often buttressed his work through an ongoing set of collaborations, each of which push his work into interesting territories while maintaining that essence of Coleclough that makes all of his albums so enthralling. His 2006 collaboration with Murmer was easily one of the best drone albums of that year, twisting field recordings and quiet sessions with electric objects into a gauzy, crepuscular blur that even made those at Artforum perk up their ears and listen.\nTorch Songs came to fruition when both Coleclough and Liles performed in Preston (probably at the request of the ever-charming Colin Potter) in 2005. In fact, much of the source material for Torch Songs originated from Coleclough’s performance to which Liles went on to ‘add, subtract, multiply, and divide’ further.\nThe fundamentals of Torch Songs are primarily Coleclough’s signature moves: swelling, resonant drones manipulated from acoustic sources and distilled into tonally vibrant beams of pure sound. Yet, Liles (who in and of himself is a fine technician of sonic alchemy to the point where he has often graced the stage alongside Steve Stapleton, Colin Potter, and Matt Waldron in Nurse With Wound) interjects his own sidereal gestures with wooden creaks, digital time stretching, radiant eruptions of dissonant couplings with Coleclough’s drones, and occasional jaunts of heavily filtered tin-can and rubber-band rhythms that parallel much of the output from Liles’ recent 12 part Vortex series. Yet for all of Liles’ baroque flares for the sonically surreal, it is Coleclough who authors the strongest material on Torch Songs through his sublime use of the drone. Jim Haynes, Aquarius Records, March 2007.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Lucas Schleicher\nSunday, 27 May 2007\nThere may not be a more satisfying album than this released all year. Wound tight around the spine of a clear idea is a simple and elegant network of art, music, and performance cemented in wonder. Torch Songs is firm and tangible: a mass of skin, muscle, and bone that strikes and, in striking, cuts a path from earth to the stars.\nJonathan Coleclough, Andrew Liles, and artists Geoff Sawers and Iwanaga Keiko have done more than offer up an album for consumption. It is impossible to pick up this release from Die Stadt and ignore the work binding the songs together: a full-color, painted poem (its contents spanning three languages) dresses this beautiful gatefold sleeve.\n\"One night I find / myself wandering / through a dark and tangled wood / The air is damp / the trees are dripping / hung with mosses and / ferns...\" Abstract music exhibits a tendency to reach for the stars too quickly, to remove itself from the confines of the body and the mud and lilt ever upwards towards the vast, black, and less exacting firmament. For those of us still riddled by gravity and the laws of the sciences, such music is a kind of escapism: whether haunting or illuminating, such music is the space where tired heads can go to rejuvenate. Over time this sort of idealism has rendered a laziness. Many artists and aspiring musicians forget why the space exists and its beauty is slowly effaced in the name of interesting sounds and a vulgar modernism that abhors any romance and every principled conviction. Coleclough and Liles, however, know better: Torch Songs is given a context and framed within a night of strange wandering. As the poem continues, stars become visible through the thick network of branches over our nameless narrator's head, but they are as of yet unrecognizable. Coleclough and Liles begin with their feet on the ground and their music opens from within the earth as it were: it is a weird conglomeration of foggy hums and metallic clattering stretching out as a flower bed. From it a further development will emerge: the stars and that space of comfort are visible, but we cannot begin there or make our journey there easily, and our artists know it.\nI won't spoil the rest of the package but this release functions as a whole and it is useless talking about the music without mentioning what it is housed in. The gatefold packaging isn't merely artwork, it's art conceptualized within the performance that is this project's genesis. Torch Songs began in 2004 when Liles remixed Coleclough's live performance at the Intergration 3 festival in the UK. Subsequent recordings were sent to Liles and yielded eight distinct, but unified songs made from spectral moans, glass bowls, metallic knick-knacks, wooden toys, marbles, bows, perverted bagpipes, and perhaps many other instruments of various shapes and sizes. In 2005 Geoff Sawers painted what would become the cover to Torch Songs during one of Coleclough's performances. Sawers painting not only binds this project together, it is featured as part of the music on the record: his brush strokes can be heard on side B. Torch Songs is carefully considered, a well-developed collaboration that pulls out all of the stops and convenes on a meaning or on a concrete thought and moves from there. Further art artifacts are included as images on either side of the LP sleeves and they all seem to refer to one another, each one fleshing out the strange narrative that begins in the poem.\nThe music itself is not entirely characteristic of either performer, though what I love most about both Coleclough and Liles is evident throughout. On a basic level the music runs a gamut of moods, acknowledging fear, uncertainty, meditative calm, and a lingering playfulness throughout each of the eight tracks. Despite keeping the entire project sensible and understandable from beginning to end, Liles' work on Coleclough's source material is diverse. Each side suggests the next naturally, but each side also surprises and gives birth to new elements. These elements aren't arbitrary, either: as aforementioned there's a tendency in abstract music to move too far outside the realms of the human and to create in a way that ignores the importance of structure, melody, and narrative. Liles' reconstruction may be abstract, but it has identifiable parts and works as a guide, using sound to travel from one place to the next in a natural progression. This puts each of the eight songs right at my finger tips and gives my brain some room to interact with them. I had the good luck to engage this album with good company on a dark night with the windows closed and candles lit. The music shaped the room and made the candles glow brighter, the darkness outside closed into a denser mask, and the individual I was with began to fill the room with me, as though we were the only two people left in the world. It was a singular moment when the music merged with the space and the time I occupied: that memory has been fixed in my mind ever since and will stay there indefinitely.\nTorch Songs will not likely be surpassed by any other release this year: I say this without hesitation. It is unapologetically a sumptuous work of art that goes well beyond being just another record or project between two outstanding musicians. That alone would've been enough: had this come housed in nothing more than a simple sleeve with minimal artwork, I would still be impressed by it and it would still be played quite often. But Torch Songs should be taken as an example of what a little extra time and thought can do for a record; all of the \"extras\" (the artwork, the weight of the vinyl, the presentation of the music, everything in short) renders this release far more substantial and enjoyable. I've heard individuals complain that abstract music is all form and little content, the sputtering catharsis of an air conditioner gone awry: Liles and Coleclough prove it doesn't have to be so. This album has set the bar unbelievably high for me and it's unlikely that I will look at any abstract music the same way now that I've heard it.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Lucas Schleicher\nSunday, 17 January 2010\nBurn is superior in every way to Coleclough's other collaboration from 2008. Andrew Liles' sometimes campy, often spooky penchant for drafting other-worldly drones pairs perfectly with Jonathan's texture-rich audio and their flirtation with musique concrète is both entrancing and fun. With some of the samples apparently being drawn from Coleclough and Liles' 2008 Brainwaves set, Burn has the added bonus of featuring sounds from one of the most entertaining experimental shows I have ever seen.\nColeclough's performance at Brainwaves 2008 sticks out in my mind more than almost any other show from that year. In fact, his use of the now infamous \"torch pen\" is one of the most ingenious and entertaining things I've ever seen from any performer, avant-garde or otherwise. The apparatus was simple: a couple of contact mics were affixed to a plate of glass, which was suspended from a coat hanger. With Liles controlling sound and generating waves of drone, Coleclough proceeded to take a small blow-torch pen to the glass, creating cracks that were then picked up by the mics and transformed into crystalline shards of noise. It was a transfixing and beautiful thing to see and hear, and it made musique concrète more immediate and fun for me than it had ever been before. Whether or not someone was there to witness that show might affect how much they enjoy certain parts of Burn, but this album stands on its own for many other reasons. Jonathan's clever use of fire, glass, and microphones only shows up on one song (\"Blackburn\") and it sounds excellent even without the opportunity to watch it happen live. And Liles' input shouldn't go ignored. His signature is pretty obvious through the record, whether he's editing or inserting some ghostly audio into the mix. If it weren't for his subtle hand, Burn would be a flatter and far less engaging disc.\nThe album gets off to a slow start, though, with \"Sunburn\" dragging a little bit before \"Blackburn\" kicks the record into high gear. Like Bad Light, Burn features a good deal of unprocessed audio. But, it is done to much better effect this time around, in part because Liles provides an anchor for Coleclough's wandering. Bells, chimes, pianos, strings, guitar, prepared piano, and other sundry instruments all show up on various songs, but this time they're integrated into the flow of sound more completely. In fact, \"Heartburn\" features a brief, but powerful guitar interlude that melts perfectly into the surrounding boil of clunking metal and detuned violins. This success probably has a lot to do with Liles' penchant for combining and arranging odd sounds: he finds absolutely no difficulty in blending toys, electronic gizmos, seriously demented noise, and a good bit of humor into his music. Coleclough's expanded musical palette obviously benefits from this ability. It keeps the record from being too haphazard and it lends a lot of diversity to a kind of music that can become stale and uninteresting pretty easily. The length of each track on Burn contributes to its enjoy-ability, too: only two songs exceed the 12-minute mark, and only one ventures off into 20-minute territory. By keeping things brief in some places, Coleclough and Liles make Burn sharper and harder-hitting, which means a lot for a record that features three and four-minute fade-ins, lots of slowly developing themes, and other sonic minutiae.\nFans looking for a document of the Coleclough and Liles Braiwaves performance will be happy to have Burn, but the album offers up a lot more than memories of their live collaboration. Every song is like an extention of that performance, each of which borrows from and expands upon the original conceit. With the added benefit of some studio trickery and a little refinement, their combined effort sounds even better.",

            "about": "As I enter my 50th year of existence I bring you COLOSSUS.\nCOLOSSUS is an inconceivably massive project that consists of 50 tracks all of which are 50 minutes long.\nCOLOSSUS PART ONE consists of the first 25 tracks.\nCOLOSSUS PART TWO completes the project and will be available on 11th March 2019, my 50th Birthday.\nParts One and Two combined will be just short of 42 hours of 'music'.\nThe 'songs' are extreme, simple, complex, mellow, angular and often surreal adaptations of every single hit from the last 50 years that was at Number One in the UK charts on my birthday.\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals.\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist.\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical.\nMany thanks to all the narrators who are individually credited on the track titles.\nFurther thanks to all the listeners, detractors, strangers, friends, foes and all those that were cruel or kind that have faded in and out of my existence. You, in no small way have helped me create this monolith.\nHappy Birthday to me - here's to 100.\nThis recording is numerologically accurate and anagrammatically active.\nMARCH 2018 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nWAS IST DAS\nAnyone can put out a huge output but it takes guts to maintain this high quality of hours. An epic digital box set.\nRead the full review here -\nwww.wasistdas.co.uk/colossus.htm\nDANGEROUS MINDS\nColossus spans the sublime and the abject. There are passages of exquisite beauty, and there are parts that make your bowels cramp and your teeth hurt.\nRead the full review here -  dangerousminds.net/comments/colossus_andrew_liles_42_hour_opus_reimagines_50_years_of_pop_a_dm_premiere\nECHOES AND DUST\nOne of the most important albums that will come out this year.\nRead the full review here -\now.ly/hX3m30j8NeY\nTHE QUIETUS\nIt’ll make you laugh. It’ll make you cry. It’ll change your life. Probably all three at once if you listen to Andrew Liles’ 25-hour-long Colossus Part One album... while on LSD.",

            "about": "As my 50th year of existence ends I bring you COLOSSUS PART TWO.\nCOLOSSUS is an inconceivably massive project that consists of 50 tracks all of which are 50 minutes long.\nCOLOSSUS PART TWO completes this project.\nCOLOSSUS PART ONE consists of the first 25 tracks and is also available on this site.\nParts One and Two combined are just short of 42 hours of 'music'.\nThe 'songs' are extreme, simple, complex, mellow, angular and often surreal adaptations of every single hit from the last 50 years that was at Number One in the UK charts on my birthday.\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals.\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist.\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical.\nMany thanks to all the narrators who are individually credited on the track titles.\nFurther thanks to all the listeners, detractors, strangers, friends, foes and all those that were cruel or kind that have faded in and out of my existence. You, in no small way have helped me create this monolith.\nAnother Happy Birthday to me - here's to 101.\nThis recording is numerologically accurate and anagrammatically active.\nMARCH 2019 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nDANGEROUS MINDS\nAndrei Tarkovsky called his art “sculpting in time,” but Stalker has the brisk pace of a Tom and Jerry cartoon compared to Andrew Liles’ new mega-album Colossus, a 50 LP box set released in digital form. Liles specializes in improving things, and Colossus is bigger and better music. Not only is it superior to other new records, it is superior to the 50 years of pop history it digests.\nLast March, we premiered the first half of Liles’ audio monument to his half-century between heaven and earth: 50 tracks, 50 minutes each, one for every year since 1969. With the arrival of Part Two this month, the 42-hour opus is complete. It’s about three times the length of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, 25 times as long as The Concert for Bangladesh, or 360 times the album version of “Total Eclipse of the Heart” (irrefragably scrambled in Part One).\nThe tracks, named after the songs that topped the chart on each of Liles’ birthdays, are original compositions distantly related to the number ones that inspired them—per Liles:\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals.\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist.\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical.\nPart Two brings us from 1994, represented by Mariah Carey’s “Without You,” to the present, and it is here that Liles really shines, because the hits are so much worse. If you listen to the originals, Celine Dion’s abominable “My Heart Will Go On”—bad enough in 1997-‘98—sounds like a Bach concerto next to what came after: Madonna’s “American Pie,” Westlife’s “Uptown Girl,” Chico’s “It’s Chico Time.” But when pop goes low, Liles goes high. Colossus draws strength from the passage of time that saps and enfeebles the top ten, right through the irresistible one-two combination that closes the album. By the time Edward Ka-Spel of the Legendary Pink Dots performs “Shape of You,” named after Ed Sheeran’s 2017 hit, and David Tibet narrates “God’s Plan,” after Drake’s supermarket sweep of last year, you may imagine that pop music is Tom Skerritt’s character in Alien, cocooned and begging for death, and Colossus is the muscular, merciful Sigourney Weaver who sets him on fire.\nThere is a lesson here for despairing pop fans: dross can be transformed into solid gold! All you have to do to make an Ed Sheeran song listenable is remove all of Ed Sheeran’s contributions to it, find a better Edward to sing it, and radically rewrite the music and lyrics. Then set it on fire. You can keep the original title, no problem.",

I dreamed the most while people drove the whiskey train. I screamed before men and children. All died. Make the holy real. The Miss American Ghost. Drinking, rock singing. Old you, started singing that dry die good rye music. Sacred bible and broken singing. I started my dancing years.",

            "about": "I can't remember when I first met Bathy. It was when we were very young. We were brought up in the same town and went to the same schools. In the summer holidays we did kids' stuff, rode bikes, played cricket, rolled down hills, got covered in mud and smashed things up.\nBy the time I was 12 we shared a passion for Rock and the emerging NWOBHM scene. We went to see a lot of bands, we even met Rory Gallagher. We played records forwards and sometimes backwards, listening for hidden messages.\nIt was around this time that he picked up the guitar, he was a natural from the get go. He taught me 'Smoke On the Water' on his acoustic, the first guitar I ever touched and the first song I learnt to play, the first song every budding guitarist learns. This was where and when the seeds were sown for us both to pursue a life lost in music.\nFast forward a few years and we had both moved to London. We had drifted into different musical realms, yet somehow, by fluke and circumstance, stayed in touch. I would occasionally have a chance meeting with him in some random boozer or we'd bump into one another at a gig.\nLater, with the advent of the internet, he tracked me down through MySpace and latterly we had regular banter on Facebook, our last contact being just weeks before he died.\nIn 2008 when I was working on the album Schmetaling Monster of Rock  (andrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/schmetaling-monster-of-rock),  I asked him to supply me with some acoustic bridging tracks in the style of 'Orchid' by Black Sabbath. The tracks didn't quite fit with the album so went unused. But I kept those tracks, I would have wound up using them for something eventually, now I have.\nThe two tracks that he sent have been uploaded exactly how he sent them to me, unedited, unmastered, and untouched in any way.\nAdditionally, using the tracks as source material, I have created a 'numerologically accurate' dreamscape in his honour.\nDarrell's original tracks were extensively digitally altered then cut into 54 segments. The parts were then divided onto 12 separate channels, 12 signifying December, the month he was born. I then added a piano refrain using the minor chords, DAEBA, the notes alluding to the letters in his name. These 5 notes are repeated 24 times, representing the day he was born. The piece is 54 minutes and 9 seconds long, representing the years and months he visited this planet.\nROCK ON DAZZA\nDARRELL BATH: 24/12/1966 - 28/09/2021\nTHIS RECORDING IS NUMEROLOGICALLY ACCURATE AND ANAGRAMMATICALLY ACTIVE",

            "about": "In 2007 Andrew Liles and Steven Stapleton were commissioned to compose and perform a live soundtrack for the Murnau film \"Der Brennende Acker”. The performance took place at the prestigious Cité de la Musique, Paris, France on 20th May 2008. Here is a recording of that live event available for the first time in its unabridged form of 1 hour and 50 minutes.\nSome original backing parts and themes of this recording were heavily restructured and formed the building blocks to what would later become the Nurse With Wound album ‘The Surveillance Lounge’.\n\"Der Brennende Acker” is considered to be a Murnau masterpiece. The film is dark and moody with very little romance, concentrating on the dark side of life, which is reflected in the greed, and ambition of a prodigal son who arrives home too late to say goodbye to his dying father.\nThe film was considered lost for a very long time, but in 1978 an almost complete print was found in the estate of an Italian priest who had organised screenings in mental hospitals.",

            "about": "The 11th of March 2024 marked my 55th birthday. For over 40 of those years I'd been attempting to play the guitar and over the decades I have owned many.\nI destroyed one, gave away three and returned one (I borrowed from my brother for over 35 years, a Westone Concord, the pickguard of which is used as the image for this download).\nTwo of the three I gave away were to friends' children. They, like me, were dreaming of being rock gods. I wanted to facilitate their ambitions. To my knowledge, like myself, they have all failed to become guitar heroes.\nThe guitar is an unforgiving instrument. It’s physically painful to play. It takes a long time to achieve any significant results. It’s a slow process and a whopping 90% of would-be guitarists give up on the instrument within a year.\nI have never studiously learnt the guitar in any formal way. I have a rudimentary understanding of chords, barely know anything about the key I’m playing and most scales are a complete mystery. Most dedicated beginners probably have a better understanding of the basics than myself. But incompetence and ignorance haven’t stopped me from making up my own ways of tuning and playing the instrument…and amassing more and more of them.\nI have 18* guitars. There are 18 tracks on this download, each of my guitars getting their own song. Only one guitar is used on each song and no extra instrumentation has been added.\nAll tracks are 3:05 seconds long, a total running time of 55 minutes, 55 being my age at this time.\nThe running order reflects the chronological order of when the guitars came in to my possession.\nClick 'INFO' on each individual track to read anecdotes and stories about each guitar.\n*By the end of 2024 I had collected a further 2 guitars making my collection 20 in total. Tracks 19 and 20 were added in December 2024 as an addendum to the earlier version of this release and to complete the collection.\nMARCH 2024 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

The post office, certainly in my time, was a vocation for life's outsiders. Alcoholics, drug dealers, divorcees who never got back on their feet and dreamers who never wanted, or could keep down, a 'real' job. Full of people from all backgrounds, from the very damaged to the slightly scarred, from the massively eccentric to the painfully shy. It was a perfect introduction to the workplace and the human condition.\nI bought this guitar from a guy who stole it from his girlfriend. It cost me £50, about a week’s wages at the time.\nAlthough not my first guitar, it is the one that has been with me for the longest. It needs some work and has a few lumps and bumps. But it's the only guitar that has stayed with me through thick and thin. It's a really great guitar to use a violin bow on, and, being a 12 string, you only have to look at it for it to sound good.\nNotably incorporated on my 2021 project 1221.\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/1221\nIt's almost certainly impossible that she'll be reading this, but sorry to the lady who originally owned my Kimmy Kimbara. If it's any consolation, she went to a good home, and I have not had anything stolen to order ever again, besides that one time when I got a kid to nick a drum machine from his school.",

I bought it on credit, it took years and years to pay it off.\nIt’s not my favourite guitar, but it should be as it’s the best sounding and most versatile in terms of tone. It's also one of the smoothest and easiest to play, partly due to the extra light string gauge I use on this guitar. The light gauge was recommended to me from my buddy and all round guitar guru Matt Sweeney.\nCurrently it needs a bit of work. The pickup selector is broken. There is also a chip in the paintwork which REALLY annoys me.\nThis guitar has enjoyed a few live excursions as myself playing solo, with Faust and Nurse With Wound.",

I came into a couple of hundred quid and immediately went out and got this guitar. At the time, if ever I came into any extra money, it was ALWAYS spent on musical instruments or recording equipment. I could have been sensible, but music always triumphed over fiscal rationale.\nI wanted an acoustic guitar that I could plug in instead of using microphones. So this acoustic with pickup and EQ seemed perfect for the job. BUT the problem I have found from the outset with almost ALL acoustic guitars with pickups, once plugged in, have a fairly terrible sound. They just don't sound 'authentic', they have a weird plastic sound, a terrible string intonation and a resonance that is only suited for the singer songwriter found in coffee shops and pubs...on a Sunday lunchtime.\nI always want a quick, fast and fuss free solution when recording, but seemingly, there is no easy way to getting a good acoustic sound, it has to be a mic for me.\nAnyway, this Fender is a solid guitar and great to play. There is a chip on the neck which I still lose sleep about. Caused by a fellow axe woman who dropped their guitar on it in the studio. I can forgive, but I will never forget.",

But I could never get the guitar to sound like a bass, you need a real bass. So I relented and picked this one up, an expense which I could ill afford at the time, but getting the sound I wanted mattered to me more than the mere triviality of being broke.\nThe Thunderbird shape always appealed to me because Pete Way from UFO always used one. A man who epitomised rock and roll excess and, although not the best player, was probably the most charismatic bassist of all time.",

In the UK, Gibson guitars were and are inconceivably expensive, but in the US they are half the price and a further half that price second-hand.\nMy Explorer was bought from Craigslist in San Francisco. I was there playing with NWW, so myself and Colin Potter jumped on a train to a place I don’t recall just outside SF and I got hold of this second or maybe third-hand battle scarred slab of wood and wire.\nIt sounds great and looks great now I’ve added a mirrored pickguard and well, it’s an Explorer.

                    "about": "Guitar: BC Rich\nModel: Trace Warbeast\nSerial Number: E0190729\nI always wanted a BC Rich after seeing Paul 'Tonka' Chapman play one in UFO in the early 80's. I guess, as he replaced Schenker, who was, and is, inextricably linked to the Flying V, he wanted to make his own statement and have a guitar that said 'Tonka' rather than ‘Schenker’. He used a BC Rich Mockingbird which was a fairly new and distinct looking guitar at the time. With its very unique shape it made a lasting impression on me.\nAt the time of getting this Warbeast, I was looking for a guitar with a Floyd Rose tremolo arm. I wanted to 'dive bomb' and didn't have a guitar with a whammy bar. So I found this ridiculously shaped guitar that screams Black Metal, to me at least.\nLittle did I know that you basically need an engineering degree to set up a Floyd Rose. Although I can just about set up the guitar now, it took a long time and several YouTube lessons to learn how to figure it out. Ironically, even with the Floyd Rose, a design that claims to keep the guitar in tune know matter how much you bend the strings, this guitar is difficult to keep in tune.\nThat said, tuned to drop D, this behemoth has a great neck and action, but never sit down for any extended period playing this monster as its razor sharp body will cut your legs off. Boy does it hurt. It's essentially a guitar that shouts 'look how Metal I am', a flashy guitar that looks good live.\nThe Warbeast has had live excursions with Årabrot and Liles/Maniac/ Stokes.... Just look how METAL I am, and you probably can't as the Trace Warbeast is now discontinued.",

Is it a bass? Maybe. Is it a Baritone guitar? Probably. After some research I found this guitar, a more affordable alternative to the Fender, but equally as effective. I had never had a baritone guitar before, so this was a new adventure.\nIt's not a guitar I have spent a lot of time with. The elongated neck and wider frets make the guitar a difficult proposition. After many years using the Floyd Rose tremolo I wasn't used to the Bigsby and broke a string within minutes of getting the Gretsch out of the box.\nIt's good for banging out really heavy chords using a lower tuning but not great at anything more delicate. I am sure there is a lot more to discover from this beast and I need to spend more time with this one, and get some heavier strings for it.",

One of the many who gave up trying to master the 6 string. But it's found a good home, I play it regularly. It's perfect to play slide guitar on.\nI don't think I would have ever ventured into buying one myself so it's a welcome and unexpected addition to my collection.\nI don't know a great deal about Resonator guitars but found this description of this guitar online -\nA staple blues guitar. Explore moody, characterful tones thanks to the combination of a metal cone and wooden body. Featuring a spider cone resonator and bridge, you get that iconic nasal twang. The Resonator enhances the volume of your playing, providing a loud, dark, and nasal tone – an absolute must for any blues track.",

The 8 string is associated with Jazz and Metal, but I got to thinking, what else can one do with 8 strings? I struggle with 6, so what complexities would a further 2 strings bring my way?\nIt was a breath of fresh air. I threw out the idea of playing it in any conventional manner and started to tune it in an intuitive way. The 8 string revolutionised my guitar world.\nAlthough the neck is like an ironing board, the guitar is surprisingly easy to play. I replaced the stock strings with extra heavy gauge immediately and have not really put the guitar down since. It is an incredibly enjoyable creative tool that I couldn't live without.",

                    "about": "Guitar: Harley Benton Acoustic Bass Series - 5 String Fretless\nModel: HB B35FL BK\nSerial Number: No Serial Number\nI love the acoustic bass sound Steve Harris used on the more recent Iron Maiden albums, so I started looking for an acoustic bass. I found this Harley Benton, which is probably about as far as you can get from Iron Maiden's sensibilities.\nWhen I discovered the guitar I thought, hmmm, fretless? 5 strings? It’s an unusual proposition, so why not? I really dislike the sound of the fretless bass, an instrument eternally associated with the 80's and sophisticated pop, it's really quite a horrible sound and questions why on earth I would buy one. Well, the reason is to smash conformity and create something unique and to give myself a challenge and a new approach.\nIt's an impossibly difficult and enormous guitar. There are no fret markers and it's tricky to play anything resembling a chord or tune it with any accuracy. In a way it was like picking up the guitar for the first time again. So I returned to my childhood approach to the guitar, I tuned it intuitively, in a way that was half decent regardless of convention. It was a refreshing return to ripping up the rule book. There are no rules or formalities to creating music...unless you're boring.\nIt is both the worst and best guitar I have. The worst because, for my capabilities, it's almost impossible to play conventionally, and the best, because it's made me think about what to do with it and attempt to find unique ways to be creative with it.",

It was not without its merits but didn't quite do what I had in mind for it. So a natural progression from the baritone had to be a 6 string bass, it made sense.\nI think in an alternate universe I would make quite an adequate bass player. I have to work at the guitar, it doesn't come naturally to me. But the bass in some way makes more sense. Nothing flashy, no twiddling or complex scales, just solid thumps, lumps and chunks.\nThis is a great instrument, the 6 industrial cable thick strings as opposed to the 4 of a standard bass have been no obstacle for me. It's half guitar, half bass and sounds immense. In an ideal world I would plug this throbbing mammoth into a dozen huge amps. I think it could knock down skyscrapers given the opportunity.\nMe and this machine have an affinity, we're both ugly, a bit too heavy and have a flabby bottom.",

Basically, I can make up the rules, and weird and unusual guitars can facilitate my experiments.\nWith my adoration for my electric 8 strings, I thought I needed to search out an acoustic 8 string. I discovered this guitar. But what is it? Well it's a baritone guitar with 8 strings. It is nothing like a traditional 8 string guitar, but more akin to a 12 string, a 12 string that never fully grew up. The guitar is tuned from B to B, with octave strings on the 3rd and 4th strings.\nIt's totally new to me so I have not explored it in any significant way.

            "about": "This recording pays homage to, and is partially influenced by, the Synclavier works of the late Frank Zappa who was born on this day, 21st December 1940.\nThis recording is also dedicated to the ethereal Karin Park and the enigma that is, and forever will be, Jack Barnett.\nThis recording employs (in part) The Arturia Synclavier V.\nTo learn more about the original Synclavier go here -\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synclavier\nDo The Dead Get Colder? (Binaural Mix) is an extended, slightly remixed binaural mix of Do the Dead Get Older?.\nThe result of the binaural mix should spatially transcend normal stereo, since it can accurately reproduce the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in sound waves. Binaural recordings can convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead or above. Any set of headphones that provide good right and left channel isolation are sufficient to hear the immersive effects of the recording and anyone who has even a cheap set of headphones can enjoy these recordings.\nFor optimum listening experience in ‘3D’ you must use headphones. To enhance this listening experience it is recommended that you play back the enhanced mix in a dark room, eyes closed and with no exterior distractions.\nDECEMBER 2019 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

This previously abandoned version was initially intended to be a 5.1 mix for a DVD.\nDreamy is a vile, ridiculous, sickening, relentless rhyming sonnet of 70 verses.\nThe book was a collection of exotic and erotic images that had been extensively adapted and collaged in Photoshop and spread over 48 pages. Three printers (KDG, SNA and MPO) in France refused to manufacture this book.\nThe book evolved over 5 years and eventually found a home at Timeless, the amazing French art publisher, who have issued books by some of my favourite artists including Val Denham, Trevor Brown and Shintaro Kago.\nNarration on the CD comes from Maude Swift.\n2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

And train crashes caused by metal corrosion I like to eat dolphins and whales And cutting off puppy dog tails Vandalism, rape and robbery Tedium and all forms of drudgery I have mites, lice, nits and fleas A pack of hounds with rabies I laugh at starvation And unlawful incarceration I am the calm before the storm Sharp and piercing as a thorn Rotting inside from septicaemia Ashen white with anaemia Like a pig rummaging in the trough Dribbling over you, looking to scoff Ruminating on parted folds and flaps Squeezing devils dumplings and saggy paps I’ve got welts and hideous acne Not even a mother could love me I’ve got a bundle of chromosomes to share And from washing lines I steal underwear Let me give you an enema So I can study the ephemera Lets wade in the spillage And sticky silage I giggle at plastic surgery mishaps And rampages of homicidal maniacs Crazed axe murder and abattoirs Dead animals floating in reservoirs Foot and mouth and toxic waste Chopped up bodies in a suitcase Idiots, cretins and imbeciles Corporate murder and other kills Dirty wayward little girls The fish mongers smells Dementia and hypertension Corporeal punishment and correction I’m a necromancer Nocturnal dancer I’m macabre and weird Something to be feared I’m a monosyllabic moron Cut myself through boredom I’ve got scrofula and tuberculosis Delusions of grandeur and other neurosis I’m itchy with scabies Pushing up daisies A vampire sucking on souls An actor of many roles I’m paranoid and neurotic An angst ridden psychotic I’m looking at you about to impose my will I’m looking at you with an aim to thrill I have an incredible hulk Sure to make you bulk But you just drink more Writhing all over the floor I’ve a strange persona And double pneumonia Admire the art of strangulation Indulge myself in mutual masturbation I love to unstitch an infibulated vagina Steal your medication for acute angina Cause you a pulmonary collapse And an abdominal prolapse I have multiple defects And suffer side effects From a damaged brain Immersed in the inane I’m an autisc astmatic Deranged epeliptic I can’t control myself I’m bad for your health I am a crime against nature and god Don’t spare the child – use the rod Anxiety ridden and morbid Frustrated perplexed and deluded I welcome brutal regimes And lethal killing machines I worship tyrants and satanic dictators I am revolted by genteel emancipators I’ve a fascination for gooey entrails Crucifying the innocent using nails Nothing charms me more than electrocution In a mental home or similar institution I’m a flesh creeping Gonzoid A downs syndrome mongoloid A voodoo zombie hybrid A man born with two heads I’m a paraplegic in wolves clothing A wild bear that’s gone a roaming Physically and psychologically hideous Abominal and nefarious Often I drink from poisoned lagoons And swim with snakes during monsoons I conspire with alligators and crocodiles And smile when I think of paedophiles I bump and grind all night And I’m sure to give you a fright And when you think it’s all over and done I do it again twice as hard just for fun I leave you howling at the moon For you it’s over far too soon You shout and scream ‘Do it to me one more time’ I fetch the cream the agony’s sublime I’m the ogre! The beast! Munching away at the cannibal feast I like to dig up carcasses and eat the brains Sniff your panties and lick the stains Ladies want me whether they know it or not I’m a dinosaur from the land that time forgot All the girls, dreamy and gorgeous Beg and plead with this Tyrannosaurus My body is a temple full of gloop and junk Ventricles and arteries clogged with gunk Choking up meaty bile and coughing phlegm I’d like to think I was a prince amongst men I smoke asbestos with lungs all black and blue Stale milk breath and bleeding gums to chew I have a huge stomach that bubbles and burns From a life long diet eating maggots and worms I watch another holocaust from my room with a view Decomposing remains in the corner are nothing new Flies buzz around the corpses that have turned crusty Moss grows on the skulls and bones that are ever so musty With matted hair and webbed feet You really look good enough to eat So I am going to follow you all night long Until you despair and join my throng I am partial to the aroma of turpentine and melting plastics Making love to deep-sea creatures and sexual spastics I adore war and plagues and guns and genocide Agent Orange and the misuse of chemical pesticide Car crashes and industrial accidents never bore me And nothing’s more charming than a drowning at sea I fantasise about severed limbs, shootings and decapitations Cholera, cancer and drug-induced hallucinations I collect broken rubbish I am a harbinger of diseases I foam at the mouth and keep dog and cat faeces I puree toenails and drink them by the glass I’m a beast of burden a real pain in the ass I kick up the dust amongst the rust and uranium With ugly thoughts in my radioactive cranium I am fond of the patterns caused by acid on skin I find nothing more pleasing than the ultimate sin I’m a mumbling mutant with a furry tail Licking your pungent snail trail I reek of fish, old cheese and decay Munching chunks of vomit, curds and whey I’m Godzilla with a libido Destruction feeds my ego I fondle and caress myself I get hard and rigid I want to bust open the doors of the timid and frigid I bathe in blood from sanitary towels Shower in mud and other things foul I kiss little children and smash in their teeth You could say my depravity is beyond belief I long for dark miserable nights and despise the day I reside in the tower with a sign that declares ‘stay away’ I’m proud to be a sociopath, evil, cruel and sadistic My chances for rehabilitation are unrealistic I’m unreasonable and uncaring I only consider pain for sharing I am full hate, violence and self-pity I’m King Kong smashing up your city I drool all over you and study what you are wearing And I think about the holes you have for tearing I imagine your tangled straw all warm and damp Open the portcullis and drag you along the ramp I want you to go to the toilet on my lap, then my face I want you to do things that will fill you with disgrace Do something that makes your father wish he had died And internal stuff your mother yearns to have tried I’m sick, ill and morally objectionable Have three eyes and an octopus tentacle I have carbuncles and ugly lumps A contorted spine and various humps My clothes are fashioned from raw meat Stinking dead rat shoes I wear on my feet I have horrid hands just like those of lepers Warts on my face similar to red peppers My teeth are green, rotten and twisted A gaping brown hole perpetually fisted Knobbly knees and a hideously hairy back A leaking colon that is eternally slack So have these verses been about me? No, that’s not true at all you see Because you are me and I am you We are the monster…it’s all we can do",

            "about": "DULY NOTED was released in 3 editions -\ni. DOWNLOAD\nii. DOWNLOAD + CDR: EDITION OF 25 COPIES: SOLD OUT\nProfessionally pressed CDR housed in hand-numbered printed sleeve. The CDR contains all the download tracks plus an extra track, You Live As Long As The Last Person Who Remembers You. This will not be available for download.\niii. DOWNLOAD + CDR + 12″ LATHE CUT: EDITION OF 25 COPIES: SOLD OUT\nThe lathe cut contains three additional songs, Exercise III, Exercise IV and Most Things Will Never Happen. These three tracks will not be available for download.\nThe record is housed in a full colour gloss laminate sleeve and includes a high quality A4 art print which has been reproduced on 300gsm recycled board. The package also includes the CDR mentioned above.\nLathes cut by Bladud Flies! -  bladudflies.com\nNOTES ON THIS RECORDING\nI have pondered this release for a number of years. I wondered if it would be possible to make a piece of music that never repeated the same note and a different instrument was assigned for each note.\nI thought about methods of achieving this and have had a few trial runs at creating the concept. Mostly these have been unsuccessful.\nFirstly, I used a random approach to the instrumentation which did not work at all. In short, it sounded a complete mess. The second attempt created an incoherent rhythm with little, if any, tonal quality. Also, due to the massive amounts of processing required, the technology at my disposal was just not up to the task.\nAfter several attempts I discovered the tones used needed to be in some way sympathetic to one another. I also figured out that, in terms of the volume of processing power involved, the piece of music created needed to be divided up into smaller parts, then 'glued' together.\nThe following pieces are predominantly abstract. Due to the nature of the human condition and desire for organisation and repetition, popular music is heavily dependent on recognisable and repeated motifs. These compositions offer little in the way of 'hooks' for the listener to hold on to and the notation is largely random.\nMy impulsive nature to hear results immediately has dispensed of the want for harmonic predictability and form. Maybe I will return to this technique at a later date and construct something that utilises all the notes, but those notes will be organised in a formal structure and harmonically complimentary fashion.\nNOTES ON THE COMPOSITIONS\nThe first track is composed of 91 notes, each note has been assigned a different 'instrument'. Consequently, if we overlook various modulations and arpeggios, no one note is ever repeated or any one instrument ‘colour’ ever the same.\nThe first composition employs electronic instrumentation, synthesizers, electric organs and samples etc.\nTrack two employs the same principle compositional technique as track one, but the notes are played in reverse and other notes are inverted. Subsequently, each individual note is played nine times, instead of just once as in the previous composition. Track two employs just the sound of a single piano.\nTrack three is a variation of track two, this version also has each individual note played nine times. The instrumentation used is 1 vibraphone and 3 pianos, 1 of which is set to a lower octave.\nTracks 4 and 5 use the same principle as tracks two and three, each individual note is played nine times. Both tracks 4 and 5 employ 4 separate synthesizer sounds that continually evolve with the use of an array of filters, effects and volume control.\nThe final track has been constructed by using a 'Hocket' method of composition.\nTo read more about 'Hocketing' go here -\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocket\nThe bonus CD track is also a 'Hocket' composition, but composed in a less structured and looser fashion.\nOn the lathe cut A side Exercise III and Exercise IV are further compositions using the method employed on tracks 2 and 3 of the download.\nThe B-side of the 12\" is a further 'Hocket' composition using an array of synthesizer patches.\nJULY 2020 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "credits": "released March 1, 2020\nREVIEWS\n5:4\nI’m no lover of vinyl. Quite the opposite, yet some of the best musical creations I’ve ever heard all stem in some respect from its archaic world of spin and surface noise, pop and crackle. A full decade ago i was marvelling at Cosey Fanny Tutti and Philippe Petit’s miniature EP Mist While Sleeping / Invisible Whispers, where noise and implied irregularities of rotation speed make for a deliciously queasy and claustrophobic soundworld. Petit went further in my best album of 2013, the astonishing Needles in Pain, which turns the simple facts of how records are physically played into a glorious fetishistic fever dream. And then there’s Leyland Kirby’s peerless Everywhere at the End of the Time, a regular fixture on 5:4 in recent years, where ancient shellac 78s become the basis for a devastating exploration of the development of dementia. All of these are outstanding in the way they explore and exploit the primitive nature and consequences of vinyl playback.\nAndrew Liles‘ Entries of Confusion is another work that investigates this arena, from the perspective of the literal ins and outs of the record, specifically the run-in and run-out grooves. Liles’ description of the piece elaborates how it’s\n'...constructed from the run in and run out grooves of 33 different copies from my [Ozzy Osbourne] Diary of a Madman collection of LPs. 33 beginnings and 33 endings. It is both the beginning and the end of the record, but not the album at all. […] The loops have been further manipulated with EQ, reverb, effects and volume variations. There is no ‘music’ used from the LP and no added instrumentation.'\nWhile the Osborne album (which has been an obsession of Liles’ for decades) is clearly the point of inspiration and provided the work’s creative impetus, Entries of Confusion is nonetheless ultimately a homage to vinyl itself; quite apart from the actual sound, those 33 references, plus the duration of each of the six parts being 33⅓ minutes, are obvious nods to the rotation speed of LPs.\nConsidering what we hear, the fact that nothing extra has been added is remarkable. In the opening couple of minutes we can just about make out a weird muffled pre-echo of voices, and before long the crackle, pop and scratch begin to transform into a curious collection of bell-like chimes. As in some of Liles’ other large-scale works, there’s the immediate sense of entering into a very gradual, long-form process of evolution and development. These pseudo-bells are a regular feature in the different parts of Entries of Confusion, though they become surrounded by the most unlikely of noises and textures.\nReinforced in part by the looping nature of the material, various percussive elements emerge. Sometimes they’re discreet, in the form of strange, low poundings; elsewhere they manifest as highly dramatic, stinging accents (at times sounding for all the world like a piano being dropped from a great height) or, at the opposite extreme, like the quiet chuntering of an old machine or the absent-minded tickling of an angklung. i mentioned bells, and in fact the role of pitch throughout Entries of Confusion is fascinating. It’s surprising there should be any at all, considering the starting point for the work is short periods of essentially blank space. Yet in addition to these imaginary chimes we encounter the resonant impacts from a variety of non-existent objects and materials, oblique chords ringing out in darkness, drawn out drones and soft shudderings, and, perhaps most striking of all, blurry sonar-esque pings, as if searching for signs of life.\nNot surprisingly, though, the essence of the work is a balance between poles of noise and silence, and this resolves in highly unexpected ways. Watery and squelching textures arise (part two, ‘Where I Wander’, ends up at a place that sounds positively subaquatic), and the motes of surface crackle often coalesce into complex burblings, or via reverb become magnified into extended juddering walls of impenetrable activity, appearing to teeter at the cusp of possible feedback overload. Equally, there are many occasions when everything reduces almost to nothing, as if we were hearing little more than the equivalent of particles of dust falling onto cotton.\nThis last point is significant, as throughout Entries of Confusion Liles manages to strike a superb balance between active and ostensibly passive forms of creativity. Though everything about it is overtly artificial, very obviously painstakingly created, it’s impressive the extent to which it so often sounds plausibly hands-off, almost like a natural and organic phenomenon. Another paradox is that, while the prevailing impression is of a kind of ‘peripheral music’, it’s nonetheless uncannily compelling. Indeed, the first time i listened to Entries of Confusion, as soon as its 200 minutes had finished i immediately had to play it again – and while i’m fond of large-scale works, i think it’s the first time i’ve ever been motivated to do something like that. Perhaps it’s due to the fact that, by the end, i had become so accustomed to the nature, composition and limits of its particular soundworld that getting on with something else or even just sitting in silence felt and sounded ‘wrong’. Returning to it was the only thing that felt ‘right’. It’s easy to describe music as being “hypnotic”, but in the case of Entries of Confusion this can evidently take on a much more literal meaning.\ni spoke before about evolution and development, and it’s true that through the course of its over 3-hour span this aspect is mesmerising. But while it pulls us in, envelops us even, the music is nonetheless elusive, phantasmagorical, always one step removed. It’s like discovering yourself in a description of someone else’s dream. Perhaps it’s this element of distance – in addition to the inherent properties of vinyl – that lends Entries of Confusion an extra hauntological connotation. This is why i called it ‘peripheral music’ earlier: sound that’s both literally and figuratively always at the cusp or the fringes of an implied something else. It perpetually hints at something else, in the process becoming something entirely new itself.",

            "about": "This recording is an abstract homage to easy listening music, the sounds of Esquivel, Les Baxter and Martin Denny. A trip through 1950’s Exotica. An interpretation of mysterious desert islands, curious religious practices and strange flora and fauna.\nIt is also, in part, a collection of incidental music, instrumental passages and soundtrack pieces that I have imagined for ‘Crazy From The Heat’. A 1985 film that was written by and starred David Lee Roth… a film that was never made.\nThis recording is in no way connected to, approved by or related to David Lee Roth or associated companies.",

I’ve even spent some intimate moments with yo mama and yeah, yer sister too.  But one place I’ve never been to is the mysterious island of Ndogo. An island way out in the big blue ocean. 6 thousand miles away from civilisation, untouched by the modern world. An island that few have heard of, let alone visited. An island of strange creatures, exotic flora and fauna and bizarre customs and rituals. The heat is on. I’m on my way.",

Like anyone who has too much money, too much time, no idea of how regular people go about their lives, You know someone who is really special, someone like me, I’m looking for enlightenment. Spiritual transcendence. An audience with the gods. I’m pretty sure when I come knocking, those cats will open the door with a cheesy smile on their faces and shake my hand.",

You pay him a bunch of dollars and he gives you the potion.  To work properly you have to take Whyaskher on a full moon wearing a ceremonial robe, which is basically a pink leotard. After several hours of ass pissing you will soon be aware of all the secrets of the universe. The very essence of existence laid bare right there in front of you. It’s the real deal. Nothing at all to do with wish fulfilment or self delusion or going into a psychotropic state by taking hallucinogens. No. It’s a genuine extra sensory once in a lifetime experience. One you ain’t ever gonna understand.",

He says a few magic words and waves his hands over the potion and then he’s gone. Vanished. Poof.  So I get drinking. My stomach is churning after sinking the worst liquid I’ve ever been tasted in my goddamn life. And boy, let me tell yer have I drunk some terrible drinks with some terrible drunks. But this one, wow, this is next level nasty.  After about an hour it seems the Whyaskher seems to be doing the do. The lemurs in the trees start chanting. The snakes and toads and the trees all start chanting. They are shouting in a strange human language like I’ve never heard. They are going crazy invoking the gods. I’m going crazy from the heat. All the animals all the plants are chanting! Chanting chanting chanting. Screaming! I’m surrounded by colours unseen by human eyes. Everything is spinning.  The animals keep on chanting and chanting.",

This is the first time this recording is available digitally.\nThe ‘Through Time’ series is based on ideas around the concept of time, the passage of time, time travel and also in part on the writings of John von Neumann, specifically his ideas on the self-reproducing universal constructor and his lecture ‘The General and Logical Theory of Automata’. More about von Neumann can be read here.\nThis is the fourth and final part of the ‘Through Time’ series.\nArt by Babs Sanitini.\n2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

Soft-boiled brittle shell Mothers singing in heaven, father burns in hell And when all is said and done I robbed myself of my own life All that remains is the lone piper blowing over the sea to Fife The feeding tube Cold baby food The toothless wonder Force feeding Rats breeding The feeding tube Cold baby food The toothless wonder Sanitary bleeding I have no feeling…in the feeding tube",

            "about": "A perfect meeting of minds between Liles and Faust's Jean-Hervè Peron.\nREVIEWS\nMy Ears, My Ears!\nA collaboration between Jean-Hervè Peron of Faust and Andrew Liles of Nurse With Wound.\nAndrew Liles seems to be flavour of the month at the moment. Popping up here there and everywhere. From remixing classic Current 93 albums, to performing with Nurse With Wound to this most unlikely of collaborations. If you’d have asked me who I thought Andrew Liles was likely to be working with next, Jean-Hervè Peron would never have been someone I would have thought of. I always associate Andrew Liles with a very electronic/ experimental sound much more built up from samples and keyboards and then processed rather than the more traditional sounds of guitars, drums and vocals that we get here. That said this does work pretty well and they have created a very entertaining album.\nThe album starts with its longest piece “The Drummer is on Valium.” I love this track. Basically consisting of JHP saying “The Drummer is on Valium,” backed by a tribal sounding drum pattern sounding not too dissimilar to Faust or maybe Nurse With Wound’s “Swamp Rat.” After a couple of minutes a guitar comes in with a sound very much like that from Faust’s “Baby” from 71 Minutes of Faust. The eight minutes this runs for fly by and I’d be more than happy to have an extended version to listen to.\nNext up is “I Do Not Like To Get Wet,” a cheerful little piece played on what sounds like a couple of different brass instruments with the odd other sound thrown in for good measure. No vocals on this one and it has a sort of oompah pah feel to it.\n“Shut Up and Sit Down,” follows, a pleasant acoustic guitar track as the back ground with some little “additional “ sounds that have Andrew Liles written all over them. Vocally we get JHP basically saying the title in French with slight variations here and there. All reminds me of Daevid Allens early 70’s solo albums. It’s piece that wouldn’t be out of place on Faust IV.\n“Cuculiformes” is a short gentle guitar piece that follows on nicely from “Shut Up…” it’s a nice interlude before the heavier sounding “We Are Ready Here,” starts. This begins with a deep resonant synth line that suddenly is blasted away by a powerful synth solo line and trebly distorted guitar. All very manic and underpinned by the original synth line that’s hiding nicely in the background waiting until it get s a bit of quiet to get itself noticed again. This is very much a Faust track to me. Andrew Liles isn’t particularly noticeable or at least is contributing in a style I wouldn’t expect of him.\n“Sans Paroles,” is another one of those gentle guitar tracks that wouldn’t be out of place on Faust IV.\nThen we have “The Fly on the Windowsill is Dead.” There’s definitely a big Nurse With Wound influence going on here, or at least a Steven Stapleton one. This reminds me very much of Current 93’s In Menstrual Night album. An eerie sounding track with lots of creaking, groaning and low pitched hums only given slight respite in the middle with a montage of vocals by JHP and some brief speech samples. I would have to suggest this track is too short and it would really benefit from being given longer to develop more and to be allowed to really suck you in. It’s a good piece but I could definitely have done with more of it.\n“Shake Your Hooves,” is another piece that is more Faust than anything else. It’s a huge groove of bass, drums and guitar sounding like it could have been the noisier more extrovert brother of Faust’s ”Listen To the Fish”, or “Hurricane.”\n“Nosferatu” is another pleasant guitar interlude with some whistling and singing from JHP to accompany it. A calming track to take you down from the intensity of the previous two.\nNext is “I Lost Faith In Words.” It’s a jazzier affair. The sort of backing you might get to a Kerouac spoken word album. Instead of Kerouac we have JHP narrating in both English and French. Not a bad track but probably my least favourite on the album.\nThen we’re back to the NWW humour “Congo Bongo La La La.” Starts with some ambient drones backed with some gentle bongos only to suddenly turn itself on its head with a burst of humourous vocals very much in an early Nurse With Wound style.\nAnother guitar interlude arrives as “?” the shortest piece on the album but perhaps just there as a break before “It’s Too Loud.” One of the strongest pieces of the album this starts with what sounds like some string synth sounds and the occasional guitar note and JHP discussing the sound levels with Andrew Liles. It’s mutates into JHP speaking German and then slowly builds. The intensity of the sounds increases with a guitar riff some snare drum and JHPs vocals and becomes a lovely piece of prime Krautrock.\nThe whole album finishes, appropriately enough, with “Fini.” A short one minute track with a small thud and some crackles as a background to JHP talking and then it all ends with the word “fini” repeated a few times.\nI was really unsure of what to expect from such an unlikely collaboration but I found it to be a really enjoyable album and one that I’ve returned to plenty of times in the last week and can see myself continuing to do so for some time to come.\nBrainwahsed\nFaust’s Jean-Herve Peron joins Andrew Liles for an album full of childlike joy. From the electric colours of the sleeve to the electric performances on the disc, this is a wonderful way to spend three quarters of an hour. Both artists sound like they are having fun and the cheer definitely filters through.\nThis is a fitting sister album to the Faust and Nurse With Wound collaboration Disconnected. There is a more playful vibe to Fini!, from Peron’s lyrics (although some of it sounds like idle studio talk removed from its original context; “Is this Kate Bush?”) to Liles’ disorientating arrangements. Taken together, the 14 tracks that make up this album are as varied as anything dotted throughout the Faust or Andrew Liles back catalogues but all the songs sound like they belong together. There is the kraut stomp of “The Drummer is on Valium” and the philosophical “I Have Lost Faith in Words;” both similar in spirit but very different in execution.\nThe majority of the pieces here are on the shorter side of things, ranging from 40 seconds to a couple of minutes in most cases. Sometimes I feel like they have been stopped far too early, ideas that could go further are stopped short but it never feels like I have been short-changed. Tracks like “Congo Bongo La La La” might well deserve to be longer but they still pack the punch that you want and realistically, there is only so many long songs an artist can do in their careers before they need to shake things up a bit (and both Liles and Peron are no stranger to long songs).\nNot that it is all little snippets of sound, there are some meatier pieces on the CD. The twisted Middle Eastern music by way of Wümme in “Shake Your Hooves” is very satisfying. For five glorious minutes, a fuzzed out bass guitar propels the track along like a runaway horse. It is the perfect length, not outstaying its welcome but sticking around long enough to sink your teeth into. However, things get even better with “It’s Too Loud” as Peron appears in both stereo channels in various languages while a Velvet Underground style guitar rhythm builds up in the background. If VU kicked Lou Reed out of the band and hired Peron in his stead then “Sister Ray” would probably have started like this.\nConsidering Liles has played live as part of Faust and there is at least one planned performance of Fini! later this year, I dearly hope he continues to work with Peron either in or out of Faust. This album is full of superb moments and it would be a shame if this was to be the only release by the duo.\nWeirdomusic.Com\nWhen mayhem artists like Nurse With Wound’s Andrew Liles and Faust’s Jean-Hervé Peron conspire, the result might be described as acousmaniac. Fini! is an arsenal of fun that comes on like a vibra-gun blast to the pineal gland. The glorious studio tomfuckery of “The Drummer is on Valium,” Fini!’s opening cut, let’s us know in no uncertain terms that Krautrock hasn’t stopped mutating after all these decades, nor has it been successfully recycled by the archons of mainstream airwaves. That’s one thing that makes Fini! delightful. It comes on like an artifact from an alien culture excavated by reanimated Dadaists from five feet of moon-dust. Touch not the obelisk lest centuries of Germanic gnosis light up your central nervous system like Meister Eckhart’s pinball machine. This wanton little orgone-grinder is enhanced with blasts of blago-bung plus multi-lingual spoken word. “Congo Bongo La La La,” coming in shy of two minutes, stands out with brilliant eccentricity, teasing us with a slow build up of La La La before the Congo Bongo briefly shakes the bachelor tree house until it disgorges all the monkeys. While most cuts are incredibly brief, leaving the listener a little hungry for more, much more, and seeming to be the disc’s connective tissue, “Shake Your Hooves” rises up like a delirious five-minute ethno-pagan evocation of Pan.\nA sweet release like this demands its own context, maybe a dainty tea-party of genteel aristocrats at which you, stripped naked with cabalistic signs emblazoned on your shaved body, spin Fini! at maximum ear-bleeding intensity before setting fire to the curtains and riding off on a white ass. You can claim that you did this at the behest of “It’s Too Loud,” which sounds like it was recorded on a Messerschmitt. If this impromptu circus doesn’t result in the New Aeon of Amon Düül IV, all is lost. Out of this world! – Steve Aydt\nWonderful Wooden Reasons\nIt doesn’t take a genius to infer from the name of this zine that it’s writer is something of a Faust fan (it’s a line from the track Meadow Meal on the first Faust album). I’m besotted by the music these fellas make (in whatever incarnation) and Fini! is no exception.\nVery much in the Faustian spirit this is a tangled morass of sounds and ideas that works really rather well. We even get to hear (on track 9) the side of Peron that is rarely seen these days, that of the acoustic troubadour as he slowly weaves his guitar and voice (and whistle) around a happy little ballad. Occasionally the album drifts into fully abstracted experimental territories but this is really to be expected of both participants and their wonderfully obtuse sensibilities but at all points you feel that they are working to a cohesive vision that they never once loose sight of. If only everything in life was this good.\nOctopus\nAprès avoir participé sous les étiquettes de leurs “groupes” respectifs, Nurse With Wound et Faust, à l’expérience de chassé/croisé musical de Disconnected, Andrew Liles, désormais alter ego de Steven Stapleton dans NWW et Jean-Hervé Péron, meneur français du combo d’Outre-Rhin, franchissent encore une fois le Rubicon pour une nouvelle étape de leur cheminement collaboratif. visuel Andrew Liles + Jean-Hervé Péron\nFini ! a à peine commencé que l’on sent parfaitement la touche de chacun. L’art de l’échantillonnage et des liaisons sonores – dans un registre à la fois poétique et intrusif – d’Andrew Liles façonne les ambiances des morceaux comme un écrivain jouerait de la force des cadavres exquis, avec un balancement entre légèreté et tension qui balise le terrain pour la vitupérance toujours aussi singulière de Jean-Hervé Péron. Entre goût avéré pour les guitares criardes, qui surgissent, seule sur “The drummer is on valium” ou accompagné de l’orgue sur “We are ready here”, et ce décalage verbal caractéristique, relent jovial d’une francophonie insolite qui amuse visiblement l’intéressé (“Shut up and sit down”, “The fly on the windowsill is dead”, “I lost faith in words”, “Fini !”), Jean-Hervé Péron slalome avec une truculence évidente entre des formes musicales qui demeurent instables et inattendues. Perturbées par les intonations râleuses en studio de Jean-Hervé Péron, “The fly on the windowsill is dead” balance avec une incroyable facilité et sans qu’on y trouve rien à redire entre la causticité drolatique de certaines séquences et une évanescence post-ambient des plus réussies. Chaque morceau procède de cet équilibre bancal, de ces respirations musicales inspirées et expirées selon des registres variés, mais avec des moments privilégiés quand même en matière d’intensité sonique comme sur le très bouillonnant et électrique “Shake your hooves”. Comme cela est fréquent dans ce genre d’approche musicale iconoclaste, les morceaux de format courts sont légions (huit titre font moins de trois minutes) mais dépassent la thématique de l’interlude pour ouvrir des pistes qu’on aurait peut-être aimé entendre développées (l’ethno-jazz frissonnant de “Congo bongo la la la” ou les digressions mélodramatiques à l’accent d’Europe central et autres butinages musicaux en contrepoint d'”I do not like to get wet”). Des choix compréhensibles sans doute, quand on sait que le disque a été enregistré en 36 heures et mixé/masterisé en une semaine, mais qui ne nous empêchent pas de garder l’oreille inmanquablement collée à ce fil d’Ariane musical, ondulant entre les matières sonores et les scénarios auditifs alambiqués.",

            "about": "Originally released as a 7\" for Die Stadt records in 2008.\nREVIEWS\n\"Following three excellent mini CDs produced with the top layer of sonic experimentalism, Clodagh Simonds teams with here Micheal Begg, Fabrizio Palumbo and Laura Sheeran, all under the guidance of Andrew Liles (rapidly climbing up to the top layer) to record two lovely tracks. 'Gone' has piano at the heart of the piece and Simonds heavenly vocals solo with beautiful ambient like electronics humming sparsely about. 'Every Evening' has a strange narrative by Palumbo and multi-layered singing by Sheeran and Simonds and has a fairy tale like atmosphere, but with an unsettling undercurrent in the piece. This is beautiful too but much more spooky. Way too short on this format, one could only want some more after this. Fascinating, beautiful, small treasure.\" FdW, Vital Weekly",

            "about": "ANVÅR is Ivar Bjørnson and Andrew Liles with guest Mélanie Duperrex.\nIvar needs no introduction, as a luminary in underground Metal, he has been creating innovative music for over 30 years with his ground-breaking band Enslaved.\nANVÅR was hatched in 2021, amid the chaos of the Covid pandemic. One of the few positives of those years was that it afforded some artists time and space in which to investigate channels they may not have previously considered.\nAfter some idle chit-chat, Ivar and Andrew discovered they were both owners and fans of vintage Roland synths.\nAndrew has a Roland SH-101\nIvar has a Roland SH-1 and a SH-1000\nSo a plan was made to create an album in homage to those synths, a very analogue recording with strict guidelines.\nThe concept was to ONLY use the Roland keyboards, nothing else, no extra instrumentation, just the Roland synths. All songs could be no longer than ten minutes ten seconds and only minimal post production and effects were allowed. The words, eloquently narrated by Melanie Duperrex, are, in part, taken from Roland manuals.\nIn an era when musicians have endless choices at their fingertips and VST plugins can emulate practically any instrument with incredibly convincing accuracy, Andrew and Ivar wanted to go back in time and create a recording of authentic analogue integrity. Hailemal is the result.\nANVÅR are:\nIvar Bjørnson: Roland SH-1+ SH-1000\nMélanie Duperrex: Voice\nAndrew Liles: Roland SH-101\nCover Art: Marcelo Vasco (Renowned for his iconic designs for Slayer, Machine Head, Kreator, Dee Snider, Soulfly, Dark Funeral and more).\nMixed and Mastered: Liles\nLP is released in an edition of 100 copies. Black vinyl with full colour insert.\nCDR is released in an edition of 40 copies. Professionally pressed CDR comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve.\nRelated:\n10 Questions to Ivar Bjørnson\nwww.andrewliles.com/10-questions/ivar-bjornson/\n10 Questions to Grutle Kjellson\nwww.andrewliles.com/10-questions/grutle-kjellson/\nHan Valen – project featuring commentary and narration from Grutle Kjellson\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/han-valen",

            "about": "This recording is inspired by the piano works of Olav Fartein Valen (25th August 1887 - 14th December 1952). Valen was a Norwegian composer, notable for his work in atonal polyphonic music.\nValen first came to my attention via the excellent documentary 'Heimvegen', a 12 part series about my friends, Enslaved.\nAs I was creating the tracks for this album, I would send rough mixes to Grutle Kjellson, who is a distant relation of Valen. Confusingly, Valen was Grutle's great grandmother’s cousin, his great great great grandfather’s grandson and his great great grandfather’s nephew!\nIn response to listening to my creations, Grutle would reply with voice memos about the life of Valen. Insightful and complementary to the music, giving a deeper context to the album and life of Valen, I thought it only logical that these voice memos be included. Many thanks to Grutle, who offered so much insight and gave so much time to this project.\nHAN VALEN is released in 3 editions –\ni. DOWNLOAD\nii. CDR: EDITION OF 25 COPIES : SOLD OUT\nThe CDR contains all the download tracks plus an extra track, Utbrudd. This will not be available for download. The professionally pressed CDR is issued in an edition of 25 copies. The disc comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve .\niii. CDR + LATHE CUT LP: EDITION OF 25 COPIES\nThe lathe cut features ‘Opp Og Ikke Gråte Mixes’, alternative and abridged versions of the download and CDR versions of the album. This version will not be available for download. Package also includes CDR mentioned above.\nMAY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "In March 2017 I was asked by my friend Graham Erickson to supply ambient sounds and atmospheres for a site specific event. The event involved a number of musicians who played in various rooms around a huge house in Hans Crescent in London. My soundscapes were played throughout the entire house. The event was created for, and funded by, a very famous fashion house to entertain some of its key clients.\nI recently found the multi-tracks on an old hard drive. There was a tentative plan to release them, but that never came to fruition. The hard drive included recordings of all the musicians involved, all their parts have been removed and only my contribution remains on this recording.\nThe original files on the hard drive are 3 multi-track recordings, a 'dress rehearsal' and the 2 live recordings of the two nights we played. The files combined would be just under 9 hours long but have been edited down to under an hour.\nMany thanks to Graham Erickson who kindly invited me to participate all those years ago.\nJANUARY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "The music on this recording was created using photographs of 20 Polyphon discs.\nThe photographs were imported into i2sm which converts digital image files into music. It analyses the brightness, colour and saturation of pixels in the image and converts them into MIDI. The MIDI generated was then further adapted. Instrumentation, samples and incidental events were added and transformed for aesthetic and musical continuity.\nA Polyphon is a disc-playing music box, a mechanical device first manufactured by the Polyphon Musikwerke. Invented in 1870, full-scale production started around 1897 and continued into the early 1900s. More about the Polyphon can be read here -  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon\nIDIOPATHIC RENAISSANCE was released in 3 editions –\nI. DOWNLOAD\nII. DOWNLOAD + CDR: EDITION OF 30 COPIES: SOLD OUT\nProfessionally pressed CDR housed in hand-numbered printed sleeve. The CDR contains all the download tracks plus an extra track, '0170'. This track will not be available for download.\nIII. DOWNLOAD + 2 x CDR + ANTIQUE POLYPHON: EDITION OF 20 COPIES: SOLD OUT\nContains the CDR mentioned above plus a further CDR, a 40 minute remix of Symphonium Star Wheel which originally appeared on the 2009 album OUARDA (THE SUBTLE ART OF PHYLLORHODOMANCY). This bonus CDR will ONLY be available to customers who buy the Polyphon edition.\nThe package also includes an original Polyphon disc. The Polyphons are 39.5cm discs which will also play on a Regina Musical Box of the same size. They were made c.1900. The discs are in various conditions consistent with their age. No attempt has been made to clean the discs and their playability may be variable.\nFEBRUARY 2022 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "Various underground luminaries remixing Liles tracks.\nREVIEWS\nVITAL WEEKLY\nAndrew Liles has had a busy year; only recently his collaborations with Daren Tate (Without Season Parts I-IV) and Tony Wakeford (Cups In Cupboards) were released. Add to this his recent brilliant solo CD Mother Goose’s Melodies Or Sonnets From The Cradle featuring narration by England’s most favorite eccentric Lord Bath, plus several projects (including one with Steve Stapleton) lined up and you have a very busy man. In fact so busy, that his latest CD is a remix project. On this poetically entitled disc (Liles loves his titles) we find a host of well-known Liles-friends such as Paul Bradley, Colin Potter, Jonathan Coleclough, Bass Communion, Aranos, Darren Tate, Irr. App., Hafler Trio, Nurse With Wound, Vidna Obmana and Freiband paying aural tribute to the man. Each of these artists re-work one of Liles tunes with often-impressive results.\nAt times the mixes remain close to the original gentle collages (like the mixes by Bradley or the very recognizable piano theme Potter uses) or more like soundscapes such as the tracks by Coleclough, Tate, Nurse With Wound (a Soliloquy no less) and Bass Communion. Ruse and The Hafler Trio deliver trademark, more abstract versions and Freiband submits, compared to the other tracks, the noisiest piece of them all. It is interesting to note that as much as these tracks are made by individual artists with individual styles, this CD still sounds as a coherent project, which makes for enjoyable listening and is probably why this is released under the name Andrew Liles. Another intriguing and highly enjoyable addition to the already impressive Liles-catalogue. (FK)\nTOUCHING EXTREMES\nBy now affirmed as a uniquely talented soundscaper, for this occasion Andrew Liles called fifteen artists to the task of remixing his own music. The few lines of a review are not enough to decode the complex messages disclosed by these disfigured contemplations, as Liles’ work is truly mythical in its impossibility of being pigeonholed. His overtones are bathed in engulfing frequencies, sapiently interspersed with ironic convolutions and aural descriptions of transfigured wonderlands where rabbits eat Alices spitting their pieces in kaleidoscopic whirlwinds. That said, at least four remodelers of shadowy tales stand out in excellence; Irr. App. (Ext.) emphasizes the nostalgic and the sublime, Hafler Trio transmutes everything he puts his hands on into grey ice, Nurse With Wound seem to include Liles in their lineup while Colin Potter’s remix somehow reminds of Salvador Dali’s surrealist pictures. But all of this music brims with extravagant views on forms of life we aren’t likely to meet often.\nWRECK THIS MESS\nAndrew Lilies propose des pièces musicales qui sont paradoxalement à la fois très dépouillées et imagées, bruitistes et méditatives. En un mot: iconoclaste. L’intitulé de certains de ses enregistrements témoignent de cette démarche : The Gazogene Machines, Seidlitz Powders, Bruising Roots & Rhizomes EP ou bien Four Compositions Created For An Imaginary Performance By The Legendary John Fare; sans oublier Mother Goose’s Melody Or Sonnets For The Cradle. Il met en scène la trace sonore de différents matériaux et objets, des bribes de conversations téléphoniques, de délicates textures parsemées de craquements, des notes fracassantes qui résonnent dans un silence spectral, des bruits passés sous les arcanes de nombreux traitements, etc. Ce mélange de collages, d’improvisation et de composition pure qui puise ses éléments à des sources analogiques et numériques “entre en résonance” avec les travaux de Steven Stapleton (Nurse With Wound), qui a croisé sa route , Colin Potter ainsi que The Halfer Trio, Vidna Obmana, Band Of Pain, Bass Communion, Aranos et Freiband (Frans de Waard) qui se sont réapproprié l’univers d’Andrew Lilies. Les amateurs apprécieront. LD\nCHAIN D.L.K\nAnyone into drones should be familiar with Liles’ increasingly recognized production by now, as both his solo works and the collaborations with the likes of Tony Wakeford (Sol Invictus), Nurse With Wound, Darren Tate, The Hafler Trio, Wander, etc. are remarkable. While rightly issued under his own name (also given the coherence of the whole set), this cd features “Andrew Liles as played by” an all star cast, probably gathering the best of the current drone/ambient circuit: Paul Bradley, Colin Potter, Aaron Moore (of VolcanoThe Bear), Jonathan Coleclough, Ruse, Band of Pain, Bass Communion, Aranos, Darren Tate, Irr. App. (Ext.), The Hafler Trio, Unsong, vidna Obmana, Nurse With Wound and Freiband. Given the quality of the starting material, and the visionaries and loonies involved, how could this disappoint? As expected, no track is less than well done, and everyone can easily pick his favourites (mine were Bradley, Bass Communion, Irr. App. (Ext.) and Nurse With Wound). Most of all, it’s a collection which faithfully portrays Liles’ sound art, both in its expanded drones and in its surrealistic collages. And by the way, the inner layout, with everything from Willy Wonka to S/M drawings passing through AC/DC, surely speaks more than a hundred reviews. Eugenio Maggi\nOCTOPUS\nVéritable sculpteur de la matière sonore, Andrew Liles livre avec In My Father’s House are Many Mansions un magnifique album, qui parvient, par quelque tour de sorcellerie, à marier l’espace de soixante-dix-huit minutes des contraires réputés irréconciliables : figuration et abstraction, bruit et silence, calme et inconfort.\nAndrew Liles est un artiste occupé. Ses états de service présentent, à côté de nombreux projets solos, une pléthore de collaborations avec les principaux animateurs de la scène drone/ambient actuelle (Nurse With Wound, Darren Tate, David Tibet, The Hafler TrioŠ). Avec un emploi du temps aussi chargé, on comprend pourquoi l’artiste sonore de Brighton s’est ici contenté de donner ses travaux en pâture à certains de ses fidèles compagnons. Et bien lui en a pris d’ailleurs, car ces derniers, loin de livrer de simples remixes, retravaillent de fond en comble le matériau proposé par le musicien anglais. Résultat de l’opération : non pas un\nempilement chaotique, mais un album homogène au parfum étrangement singulier. Jouant sur le principe des correspondances chères à Baudelaire, la musique d’Andrew Liles transcende la simple abstraction pour évoquer ici des espaces désertiques, là des formes de vie au symbolisme énigmatique, provoquant ainsi l’égarement le plus complet chez l’auditeur. Ce somptueux travail sonore chemine habilement sur une fine crête, et parvient à concilier des options pourtant contradictoires : le bruit et le silence, l’apaisement et l’inquiétude. Entre dépouillement presque total (“Song of the Ergophile” par The Hafler Trio) et esquisses rythmiques (“Auto Manipulator”, sorte de gamelan spectral) ou mélodiques (le piano de\n“All Doors Open”), ce qui s’exprime ici est un véritable art du passage, de la transition continue, faisant subtilement varier les climats sonores de l’oppression à l’obsession. Éloge de l’irrésolution et de l’ambiguïté, In My Father’s House are Many Mansions offre une ambiant à la majesté glaciale, et procure à l’auditeur le doux frisson d’une dérive contrôlée.\nBenoît Bouquin\n‘AREEN’ (supplement of Estonian weekly newspaper ‘Eesti Ekspress’)\nTumeda eksperimentaalmuusika remiksid.\nNimekate tumedama ambient/experimental-suuna esindajate remiksid Andrew Liles’ i lugudest. Colin Potter, Jonathan Coleclough, Aranos, The Hafler Trio, Nurse with Wound, Freiband, Vidna Obmana, Irr.App (Ext) jt. Suunale tüüpiliselt on siin palju veidrate häälte sissesulatamist välilindistustele. Üksteisega võrreldes on kõik lood äraarvamatud, mõned (Aaron Moore, Darren Tate) koosnevad hõredatest tükkidest (pasun, kulinad, keeletõmbed), teised tihedamast raginast (Freiband, Band of Pain, Ruse, Irr.App (Ext)). Samas paistavad kõik selle stiili esindajad silma suure, märksa avaramates piirides avalduva süstemaatilisusega, kui tavaliselt eksperimentaalse muusika puhul harjunud oleme. Kõige põnevamad ekskursioonid ongi kõige süstemaatilisemad, nt puhta tumeda ambient’i soonel kaevandavad Bass Communion ja Coleclough, kelle lugudel on mitte ainult kõlalist, vaid ka sisulist katet. Stilistiliselt huvitavaima, rütmilise ja saagiva, minimalistliku, samas meloodilise, õige raskesti määratletava töö teeb Aranos. 9\nErkki Luuk\nSKUG\nDie Fourth Dimension ist nichts weniger als ein Label, auf dem u.a. ANDREW LILES mythische Soundscapes veröffentlicht. »In My Father’s House Are Many Mansons« trägt zwar seinen Namen, jedoch wagen 15 Remixer aus dem britischen Experimental-Underground Neuinterpretationen. Darunter so illustre Acts wie Nurse With Wound oder The Hafler Trio, die in galaktische Sphären vordringen. Obwohl etwa Band of Pain auch heftiger zugange ist, ergibt das doch ein recht überirdisch schillerndes Spektrum, das ganz dem Naturell des Schöpfers Liles entspricht.\nSANDS ZINE\nIl remix delle cose che inquietano\nLe cifre intonacate dei drones fanno guarire anche i pensieri schiavi di esistere. Impossibili discernimenti che sono tutte trilogie della morte alla Radigue, scampoli di riduzioni esoteriche, finestrelle provvisorie che hanno la duplice funzione di mostrare dentro chi c’è. I drones sono anche refusi di clessidra, titaniche mutezze che si dicono libere, un tenue polimonio d’impronte digitali quasi feretrie che somigliano all’estate deserte dei tramonti nottambuli. Andrew Liles, coiliano, current93iano, ha certamente guardato la trasposizione dei coralli sotto alle lande deserte dell’abisso perché “In my father’s house are many mansions” è un disco fottutamente abbondante di souvenirs, ed è impastato netto di misterismo e sentieri affamati che si sognano e si segnano dell’abbondanza.\nL’abbondanza deriva dal fatto che questo sia un disco di remix, non solo dall’abbondanza, e pure dal fatto che l’elettronica, anche quando non si cimenta coi remix talvolta sfiora il plagio, e se pure qui non conosciamo i limiti tra creazione, ripetizione e ripescaggio, il lavoro rimane abbondante e pregno di metafore. Opera misteriosamente radunata in mimiche passeggere, forse prospettica, perché dietro gli strumenti, a contatto, a corda, a ricordo, si celano altri raduni che si spalleggiano come se vacillassero e fossero sparsi dietro una stringa eternamente annottata. Questa musica è una ricaduta che ti spezza il respiro nella musica del Badalamenti più pastorale: è un anello circolare che sprigiona fuoco nei giardini del tempo e si svena oscuramente dietro un flusso rigonfio che trasale la luce per acconsentirla. Tutte le processioni di rito alla Girard andrebbero accompagnate dalle litanie terminali radunate tutte nel nero dell’immagine della gioia come se questa si ritrovasse dietro un mondo redento e rinascere come un mondo dietro un mondo. È un museo verderame i cui trenta e passa lavori di Liles non certo si dissolvono o prendono pieghe affrante, piuttosto si riverberano di significato perché esattamente questa musica non segue alcun canone preciso, e quindi non deve concedere spiegazioni o formule accresciute e nemmeno linfe ritrovate dietro i veli, quanto piuttosto una solitudine gloriosa fatta di distese insidiose e materiali interiori. Non si comprende bene cosa voglia dirci Liles dietro la tepidezza errante di questi scenari feriti che si guardano come se evaporassero giungle in esalazioni straziate. Non si sa, non è noto sapere, quanta frantumazione sintetica si annidi ovattata dietro questi ruscelli un po’ buddhisti, un po’ solitari e mortuari della musica di Liles, se questa sia frutto di un trip oppiaceo, oppure di una tensione suicidale. È probabile che dietro i suoni si ritorcano sempre le parole graziose del distacco ed è come se ci dicessero che vogliono andar via, andar via da noi. Questa è musica che si sopporta sulle grandi vallate prima e dopo una gara di sciabole o una caccia di farfalle. È una musica mitologica, a tratti arcaica, fatta di avvallamenti e pianeggiamenti ma restia al mezzogiorno. È così mitologica perché si riscrive come remix sulla musica d’altri e tenta (forse) di interpretarli per ciò che non sono; è mitologica perché cede compulsivamente il tassello sfrenato di un riadattamento e si muove tra concretismo, musica alla Fennesz primo-cerebrale, e ritorni astrattamente parasinfonici. Il corollario che dentro vi si traccia somiglia ad un territorio cosparso di nostalgiche parentesi ed è quindi una musica d’inviluppo che si presenta fusa in tre parti identiche: nascita, mantenimento, arretramento. Convoglia dentro la sua salma teoretica delle variazioni che noi mortali non attendiamo: è stratosfera allargata, contigua e sprigiona rettangoli e quadrati d’angoscia volando via quasi come una disperata resistenza dell’integrità. Un disco profondo e sincero. Salvatore Borrelli\nFOXY DIGITALIS\nIn My Father’s House…” is a compilation of artists having a go at the many and varied works of composer Liles. As expected, the results are mixed, but even the “failures” shed some light on where and how the work of Liles has seeped into the work of other composers.\nFrom the creepy industrial hum of Colin Potter’s take on “all Doors Open” to the noir-ish amaibility of Aaron Moore’s version of “Auto Manipulator”, it is clear that Liles’ soundscapes provide a multitude of ideas. For me the highlights are Band of Pain’s pulsing, brutal goth mix of “Apathy in the UK” and the haunting and truly skin-crawling version of “Something to do with Hans Bellmer in a Pub at Last Orders using 15th Century Rural Magic” by Bass Communion.\nHere, as on Ruse’s “The Ether Reel Rendered”, Liles open and challenging lines allow the artist to incorporate them into their own sound, providing enrichment and also a new way of expressing their own work. In that context, the most disappointing readings here are by the most famous. The Hafler Trio and Nurse With Wound sound as if they mailed in their contributions, and offering little more than rehashed ideas from old work. Which misses the point of this great set, where the freedom of Liles’ music is evident in the freedom it affords these artists to play both with it and with their own sound.- Mike Wood",

            "about": "INCOMMENSURABLE MAGNITUDES (СУМЕРЕЧНОЕ СОСТОЯНИЕ СОЗНАНИЯ)\n'Incommensurable Magnitudes' is composed of 26 tracks totalling 24 hours in length. Ideally this album would have consisted of 24 tracks each an hour long but due to the limitations of the amount of data that can be uploaded to this download site, each track is 59 minutes long. To complete the full 24 hour cycle, 2 shorter tracks of 12 minutes in length ('Tea Break' and 'Up the Wooden Hill') have been added.\nThe reason for 'Incommensurable Magnitudes' coming into being is a further extension of my musical research and philosophical musings on concepts of time, already supported and theorised with my '...Through Time' quartet of releases. These notions are my own and are NOT based on any intellectual 'reason', academic discipline or mathematical 'truth'. They are personal experiments with sound, sonic structures and clichés that (for me) represent ideas about time travel, memory, illusions of time, astral travel, oblivion, OOBE, nostalgia, death, space travel, science fiction, science fact, marine biology, delirium, human anatomy, non-existence, sleep, hallucinations, suspended animation, hibernation, black holes, dark matter, vacuums, anti-matter, eternity, infinity and.... beyond.\nReleasing the recording in this digital form is the perfect format for the piece to be listened to, utilised, experimented with and enjoyed. 'Incommensurable Magnitudes' can be streamed from your digital player in its entirety from beginning to end with no breaks! It can be played as a purely functional piece of music, to while away the hours as you go about your daily routine... a faint drone in the background or a suffocating, all encompassing sonic assault. Equally it can be utilised as an aid to spend your evenings 'researching' a field of your choosing. The tracks can be played randomly or in order, none of the titles relate to any given time of day. Use, abuse and enjoy the music in any way you see fit and hopefully some of you will take on the marathon challenge of listening to it all in one day, a non-stop cycle of 24 hours.\nAUGUST 2013 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "All the lyrics used on It's Only Pain were written by Liles' father, Michael Liles. They were discovered when clearing out his spare room after his death in 2017. The poetry was written sometime in the late 70's and has been given a life here.\nContributions come from: Matt Davies, Effie Nikolaou, Arwen Schiavone, Karin Park, Faust's Jean Hervé Peron, ex Mayhem frontman Maniac and Mared Lenny (the critically acclaimed Welsh singer known as Swci Boscawen).\nREVIEWS\nThe Quietus - Noel Gardner\nAndrew Liles, an important post-millennial part of the Nurse With Wound/Current 93 ‘family’, releases music at a fairly breathtaking rate, yet It’s Only Pain is described by label Dirter as his first “general release” since 2018. Never mind the taxonomy, clock the concept: all the LP’s lyrics were written by Liles’ father in the 1970s, discovered after his death, and are interpreted – often translated from English – by multiple guest vocalists. Many are already in the musician’s collaborative orbit, some are more surprising. My recollections of Mared Lenny’s late-00s music (frankly pedestrian Welsh language indiepop under the name Swci Boscawen) did not mark her as someone with a future appearing on NWW solo projects, yet here she is on opening song ‘Skid-Row Schizoid’, narrating bilingually over a song that’s a bit like if Van Der Graaf Generator had been an influence on Fourth World music.\nLiles’ taste for dramatic arrangements can border on kitsch but more often charms. Karin Park, synthpop soloist and Årabrot member, leans into her roles with terrific relish, initially reading over sawing strings and clanging piano on ‘A Thousand Minds’ before adopting an operatic register for ‘Beyond The Cosmos’ and ‘Humanist’. Faust’s Jean-Hervé Peron hams it up spiritedly over ‘Down The One Side’s stern gothic folk and ‘Bywyd Llonydd’ revels in its diverse guestlist: Matt Davies, owner of a Welsh record store and a fine ‘dramatic reading’ type voice; Maniac, ex of black metal originators Mayhem; and Awen Schiavone, author of a children’s book about a penguin named Pedro.",

It was the first instalment in a series of 4 issued under the title of Koschmider’s Logbuch.\nKoschmider’s Logbuch is a conceptually theorised body of work that is interlinked and interrelated. The releases investigate the illusion of time, nostalgia without memory and mathematical and audio anagrams, they also continue my development of what I have coined ‘numerologically accurate recordings’ which started with the release of New York Doll in 2004.  andrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/new-york-doll-remastered\nNOVEMBER 2022 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

The releases investigate the illusion of time, nostalgia without memory and mathematical and audio anagrams, they also continue my development of what I have coined ‘numerologically accurate recordings’ which started with the release of New York Doll in 2004.  andrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/new-york-doll-remastered\nNOVEMBER 2024 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "One of the most memorable and enjoyable shows I ever played was on 25th September 2011. Myself, Steven Stapleton and Rick Tomlinson joined Jean-Hervé Peron with his Art Error Ist project at the legendary Trades Club in Hebden Bridge.\nThe show was chaotic and anarchic. It was an evening when amplifiers blew up and shards of porcelain flew across the crowd. There was the wielding of chainsaws, the stench of petrol and Steven Stapleton creating art live on stage. It was dangerous and unpredictable, the owners of the venue were far from happy with our complete disregard for health and safety laws.\nThis live recording doesn't really convey the pandemonium of the night but IT IS a souvenir of a wonderful and unforgettable evening.\nAndrew Liles: Guitar, Backing Tapes, Saxophone Beak\nJean-Hervé Peron: Coffee Barrister, Bass, Barrell, Voice, Trumpet, Chainsaw, Cement Mixer, Anarchist, Poet, Tapes\nSteven Stapleton: Painter and Decorator\nRick Tomlinson: Cornet\nSpecial thanks to Ned Netherwood and The Trades Club.\nThe original recording of 'The Drummer is on Valium' appears on FINI! -  andrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/fini",

I yearn for your crimson folds, my fairy queen I long to caress soft creamy white flesh  ... and smell apple scented fresh breath O' fair young milky maiden have ye lit the winter lights? Are you moist on these cold, damp, lonely dark nights? Warming yourself inside, stoking the fire Caressing your kitten, so full o' desire O' fair young milky maiden at last it's spring Fat cows in green fields can hear you sing I see you yonder, upon a stool squeezing teats White juice on your hands, staining your pleats   O' fair young milky maiden here comes a summers eve Let us frolic down to the village to drink wine and mead On the morn we can churn my cheese and butter With help from your little sister and baby brother  O' fair young milky maiden the autumn is calling Around us red and golden leaves a' falling My hot roasted chestnuts explode in your mouth But for now I must leave you and go down south  O' fair young milky maiden what have you to sell? Using your soft hands that can milk one so well Let me lay upon your gentle down kept so soft Rigid I stand among the hay, in the croft  O' fair young milky maiden where have ye been? I yearn for your crimson folds, my fairy queen I long to caress soft creamy white flesh  ... and smell apple scented fresh breath",

It lives inside me, ticking, tocking never stopping...I hope. Tick-tock. The first heart attack was the best. It didn’t hurt just burnt. Then they wired me up to the other machine. The one with more dials and buttons. Beep, beep, beep little bo-fucking-peep, the life support machine just kept on bleeping and buzzing.  That was when I found her. I just stuck in the key. She ticked, she tocked, she sucked my  fucking cock. Then after I paid the bill I took her home.  She was modeled on my every desire. Fire, fire, fire it ain't no joke when you see that big black smoke. Maximum overdrive slip and slide. Swarfega and angina, a very cute tight vagina. Covered in oil and stains, my MONSTER breathes love for me. What I make her do is not everyone’s cup of tea. She sipped, she sucked, she fucked and so do I. You pays your money and makes your choice this mechanical MONSTER can’t get a divorce.  010111001000101000101010010101111100101010101010010101001111100101001010100101010100010101000101010101010101010100001111100101010000101010101010101010000000101010101010111111001010110011100111001110010100010010101000 I have programmed the first machine. She has learnt to swear, she can morph and change colour. She has twenty-seven accents. A new patch filter is working well. Today she will put on her own lipstick. She is my MONSTER. I need to buy her some more clothes, the other underwear burnt. Her voice needs some more work, but the machines is going well. 010111001000101000101010010101111100101010101010010101001111100101001010100101010100010101000101010101010101010100001111100101010000101010101010101010000000101010101010111111001010110011100111001110010100010010101000 I have mastered my MONSTER. The need for real human contact has been negated. The future lies in machines. MONSTER machines, ready to serve and scream and obey.  After the humanoid element was installed all signs of artificial and mechanical proprieties have gone. My mechanical MONSTER is just like a real life human. She talks, she walks, she moans and cries. When I walk down the street everyone admires my beautiful creation. She gleams in the sun, she smells of rain and has eyes of stars.",

After rebooting her sexual features and script batching she began to growl and hiss. My miraculous MONSTER is no longer a miracle. As of this evening the MONSTER is locked in a room. Earlier she ate a dog and killed some small birds. The mechanical MONSTER then proceeded to masturbate with faecal matter. She smeared the excrement on her breasts. 010111001000101000101010010101111100101010101010010101001111100101001010100101010100010101000101010101010101010100001111100101010000101010101010101010000000101010101010111111001010110011100111001110010100010010101000 The mechanical MONSTER has improved. After some minor repairs she seems to function correctly. We then went on to enjoy some mutual masturbation and full sex. I love my MONSTER, she loves me. Things have got worse again. The mechanical MONSTER has begun to talk in a strange distorted voice. She attacked the windows and began screaming. Later she went on to throw bleach at some children and tried to perform cunnilingus on a passer-by.  Yesterday I was hospitalised by the MONSTER. She went on a rampage. Biting out my tongue and pulling one of my eyes from its socket. My arm is also broken and four teeth have been smashed out. There must be something confused in her diametric cortex. I will have to go back and find out why the mechanical MONSTER had to be deprogrammed.  Today I had to shut down the MONSTER. Tears filled our eyes as we said goodbye. Just before the machine finally switched off she said “I love you Daddy”. Then she bit off my little finger. I no longer have faith in my creations or indeed any of those of God. I am alone, again. I was born into this dark cold world alone, and will leave it in the very same way. Love has always eluded me. My mechanical MONSTER even hated me. I am so alone and cold and tired. I will join my miraculous mechanical MONSTER and all the other MONSTERS of this world. All the MONSTERS in this galaxy, all the MONSTERS in this empty empty universe of loneliness.",

            "about": "Whilst searching for the original files for a reissue of Aural Anagram, I discovered various unrelated fragments and unused recordings on assorted MiniDiscs and ancient CDRs.\nBack in the day I used my MiniDisc to record voices and environments, places I had visited or locations for specific conceptual reasons. Many of those outtakes are included here. Along with a few CDRs the MiniDisc recordings were entirely overlooked in previous Miscellany releases.\nMy archive of source material, incidental and forgotten audio, have now all been used and released throughout the Miscellany series. This brings the Miscellany project to a conclusion... probably\nMISCELLANY: ADDENDUM is available in the following formats:\ni. DOWNLOAD.\nii. DOWNLOAD + CDR. Edition of 55 copies: SOLD OUT.\nThe CDR contains I CURSE (EARLY MIX) which will not appear as a download. The professionally pressed CDR is issued in and edition of 55 copies. The disc comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve.\nThere have been 6 releases in the Miscellany series so far. All the physical copies of these releases are now sold out but are available digitally using the links below.\nMISCELLANY - Double CD-R - 2002\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY - DELUXE - 13 CD-R box set - 2003\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY DELUXE (SOUVENIRS PERDUS D’ANTAN) - 3 LP box set - 2009\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995\nMISCELLANY - LUSSUOSO (ELECTRONICS: 1990 TO 2015) - 3 CD - 2015\nDownload here -\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-lussuoso-electronics-1990-to-2015/\nMISCELLANY: MYTHOLOGICAL MARTYRS AND MALIGNANT MEMOIRS (THE LOW FIDELITY LIVIDITY RECORDINGS: 1985-1995) - 4 CD-R - 2019\nDownload here -  www.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995/\nMISCELLANY: ADDENDUM (FRAGMENTS AND INCONSISTENCIES 1999 - 2013) - CD-R - 2023\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-addendum-fragments-and-inconsistencies-1999-2013\nFEBRUARY 2023 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "Miscellany Deluxe was originally released as a 13 CDR box set in 2003. Eleven of the albums included in the box were later made available as individual downloads in 2011.\nBoth the box set and the downloads have now been deleted and will no longer be available. There have been plans over the years to issue the box as a general release, but until that day this download is the definitive collection of Andrew Liles archival recordings from 1984 to 2000.\nThese recordings were recorded on various tape machines. A compact mono cassette recorder, an Amstrad tape to tape, a Vestax MR300 and a Tascam 424. The later recordings were bounced down and mixed live on to CDR using a Phillips CDR870 CDR recorder. Aside from Love Song none of these recordings were created using computer technology.\nThe Miscellany series of releases is, in a way, a personal diary that indexes my evolution as an artist, my studio techniques and my compositional know-how. It is a warts and all exposé, a collection of fragments, memories and compositions that show wildly varying degrees of competence, success and failure.\nThis version consolidates all the releases that make up Miscellany Deluxe. It has been completely remastered for this digital release. Certain frequency and volume issues have been resolved. Some tracks were way into the red, others way too quiet. In general, the new mastering keeps the original crackles, peaks, hisses and pops to retain the rawness, naiveté and authenticity of the original recordings.\nThere were a number of duplicate tracks running throughout the discs, these have now been deleted. Also, all errors in the track listings have been amended. Mob Rules has the running order corrected to match the original CDR. Aviatophobia is now the correct stereo version, previous versions had the first two tracks in mono and at the wrong pitch. It also includes Prelude To An Un World which appears here for the first time as a digital download.\nMiscellany Deluxe includes all the Liles CDR releases issued from 1997 to 2001. Most of the original CDRs were released in extremely limited runs and were sold at live shows and to very a small mail-order clientele.\nAll the bonus tracks included did not appear on the original CDRs but were later included in the 2003 box set and the previous download versions.\nThis download includes the following CDRs in order of release -\nRC (1997) + 4 bonus tracks.\nRC was originally released as a one track CDR titled RC (EPONYMOUS). It also included an A4 sized booklet.\nROBOT (1997) + 1 bonus track\nMY PINK DERRIÈRE (RECORDINGS FROM 1984-1998) (1998)\nBIRTHDAY (1998) + 2 bonus tracks\nOriginally released in an edition of 3 copies which were given away as birthday 'gifts'.\nTHE MOB RULES (1999) + 1 bonus track\nOriginally released as a promotional CDR.\nTHE HENNAED HAND OF GLORY (2000)\nAVIATOPHOBIA (2000) + 3 bonus tracks.\nAviatophobia was initially released for a live event in June 2000 at ‘Rective’ Upstairs at the Garage, London, UK.\nVIVA! RAUDIVE! (2000) + 1 bonus track.\nInspired by the work of Dr. Konstantin Raudive (1909 - 1974). It was originally released for a live show at Cecil Sharp House, London 2000.\nI CURSE ALL THOSE WHO EVER WRONGED US (2000) + 1 bonus track\nRecorded for a live event in October 2000 at the The Plough, Museum Street in central London. Vic Rawlings played cello on the bonus live recording included here.\nTHE BULBS OF THE VESTIBULE (2000) + 1 bonus track\nOriginally released for a live event at London's Hinoeuma in 2000.\nPRELUDE TO AN UN WORLD (2001) + 5 bonus tracks.\nPreliminary studies and different recordings/mixes of songs for the Infraction Records CD release of 'An Un World' and (in part) for a live event at the Knitting Factory, New York in February 2001.\nLOVE SONG (2001) + 1 bonus track\nPrecursor to the 10\" of the same name and released to coincide with a live event (which didn't happen).\nMISCELLANY (2003)\nMiscellany was a 2 CDR 'best of ', it collected the best tracks from the above discs and included some exclusive tracks which are included in this download.\nThere have been 6 releases in the Miscellany series so far. All the physical copies of these releases are now sold out but are available digitally using the links below.\nMISCELLANY - Double CD-R - 2002\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY - DELUXE - 13 CD-R box set - 2003\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY DELUXE (SOUVENIRS PERDUS D’ANTAN) - 3 LP box set - 2009\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995\nMISCELLANY - LUSSUOSO (ELECTRONICS: 1990 TO 2015) - 3 CD - 2015\nDownload here -\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-lussuoso-electronics-1990-to-2015/\nMISCELLANY: MYTHOLOGICAL MARTYRS AND MALIGNANT MEMOIRS (THE LOW FIDELITY LIVIDITY RECORDINGS: 1985-1995) - 4 CD-R - 2019\nDownload here -  www.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995/\nMISCELLANY: ADDENDUM (FRAGMENTS AND INCONSISTENCIES 1999 - 2013) - CD-R - 2023\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-addendum-fragments-and-inconsistencies-1999-2013\n2003 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "This album was originally released as a 3 x CD album in 2015. It is a 3 hour anthology of 52 previously unreleased ‘electronica’ and ambient soundscapes from the years 1990 – 2015. The album is a blend of new material, up-dated and adapted pieces and raw, untouched and unadulterated tracks from yesteryear.\n\"It’s been an incredibly enjoyable experience putting together this 3 disc anthology. I can remember where and when each and every one of these recordings were made. A lot of the tracks were made using a SH101, Alesis MMT-8, Akai X7000 sampler and Tascam four track tape machine, all second-hand, and even at the time fairly primitive technology. One of the earliest tracks was made at a studio in North London, they used what must of been the earliest version of Cubase, at the time it was the height of sophistication.\nThe majority of the tracks were made in the early 90’s in London, an era when I was listening to a lot of music from the emerging ‘ambient’ and electronica scenes. At that point I had a part time job, I worked on the till. Through various means of ‘creative accounting’ the job afforded me to buy at least one new record every lunch break. I worked near Wardour street and went shopping everyday. I bought everything that came out on Warp, Rephlex, R&S, Apollo and an assortment of other labels. These records in part influenced what I was creating at the time.\nThere is no chronological pattern to the running order of the discs, it’s up to you to ponder when they were recorded. Some tracks sound a lot older than they actually are, and others more contemporary than the year in which they were originally recorded.\"\nThere have been 6 releases in the Miscellany series so far. All the physical copies of these releases are now sold out but are available digitally using the links below.\nMISCELLANY - Double CD-R - 2002\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY - DELUXE - 13 CD-R box set - 2003\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\nMISCELLANY DELUXE (SOUVENIRS PERDUS D’ANTAN) - 3 LP box set - 2009\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995\nMISCELLANY - LUSSUOSO (ELECTRONICS: 1990 TO 2015) - 3 CD - 2015\nDownload here -\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-lussuoso-electronics-1990-to-2015/\nMISCELLANY: MYTHOLOGICAL MARTYRS AND MALIGNANT MEMOIRS (THE LOW FIDELITY LIVIDITY RECORDINGS: 1985-1995) - 4 CD-R - 2019\nDownload here -  www.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995/\nMISCELLANY: ADDENDUM (FRAGMENTS AND INCONSISTENCIES 1999 - 2013) - CD-R - 2023\nDownload here -\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-addendum-fragments-and-inconsistencies-1999-2013\n2015 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\n5 AGAINST 4\n… Andrew Liles’ consistently unpredictable output was dominated in 2015 by this dazzling three-hour celebration of diverse electronic works dating back a quarter of a century. As the name implies, Miscellany is a veritable hotchpotch, one with a distinct leaning toward the more raw end of electronics. But this is merely the basis for a kaleidoscope of works encompassing radiophonic mayhem, intense beat-driven numbers overlaid with John Carpenter-esque basslines and/or Wendy Carlos-esque baroque twiddling, expansive ambient vistas and delicate, multi-layered bits of melodic tracery. It all makes for an entirely bewildering yet mesmerising experience.",

            "about": "This instalment in the Miscellany series brings together an array of aural oddities and childish experiments. It's an honest document - rough and raw.\nIn 1985 a trio of teenagers, myself, Alex Pergusey and Nathan Haynes, formed a band. We were, and will always be, ‘The Martyrs of Tragedy’, excerpts are included here.\nAlso in 1985 I formed my first ‘solo’ project – ‘Margaret’s Malignant Growth’. A number of tracks are included within.\nAlong with my ‘solo’ endeavours there was also ‘Gash’ a short lived (two day studio collaboration) with my friend Neil McLachlan. Two tracks were worth including here.\nA day of recording with Alex Pergusey gave me an hour long tape to explore, my findings can also be found on here.\nBefore there was Andrew Liles there was Lividity. Two cassettes were released by Lividity, one in 1987 and the other in 1993. The Lividity moniker was abandoned in 1996. Almost all of these recordings were conceived under the name Lividity.\nMost of these tracks are much longer in there original form. Some are challenging, others deserve more time and most of them are hissy.\nThis collection is the best of the worst and the worst of the best from the best of times and the worst of times.

            "about": "This album was originally released as a L.P. in 2016 by Blackest Rainbow Records.\nMonstrous Medical Mishaps (Horrendous Hospitals and Disastrous Dentistry) is a medically themed album. Many of the rhythm tracks used on the recording were constructed from an array of meticulously crafted samples garnered from an assortment of medical and dental instruments being tapped, scraped and plucked.\nCover art comes from Zeke Clough, an artist known for electronic music’s most shockingly morbid and detailed sleeve art, whose twisted designs came to define the aesthetic of the groundbreaking Dubstep label Skull Disco.\nOpen your mouth and say “AAAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!”\n2016 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "This is an alternative version of 'Mother Goose'. At the time of production the master tapes were sent to the Czech Republic to be mastered at an expensive mastering suite. Unsure of the results it was decided to use the un-mastered version of the album. Now you can decide which is the better sounding version with this download.\n2005 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\n\"The latest project from the fabulous Andrew Liles is dedicated to the notion that nothing good ever happens in a nursery rhyme, even when enunciated with such gleeful relish by guest narrator Alexander Thynn, the seventh Marquess of Bath. Scratching kittens have to be placated, half-awake children are left to wander around the town at night, and we all know about the girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead. Aided in a couple of places by Sion Orgon from Thighpaulsandra’s group, Liles takes his time over teasing out the darker strands to be found woven into childhood’s brighter moments, carefully stacking eerily sustained tones, desiccated samples and disembodied voices against Lord Bath’s exuberant delivery. The results feel like a compendium of forgotten folklore awaiting its future.\"  TheWire.co.uk.",

It was issued by Blackest Rainbow Records on clear vinyl in an edition of 300 copies.\nThe album is inspired by film noir, Yorkshire and Lancashire dialect and slang and the excellent Red Riding (a television adaptation of author David Peace’s Red Riding Quartet).\nThe album can and should be considered as part radio play, part celebration of northern English culture and an appreciation of language. The words are included in the 'lyrics' of each track to confuse and bemuse the listener.\nHEROINE: ALEX JAKO\nMURGATROYD: M.

Totally boozed... I'd been abused... by mesen I were lost physically and emotionally Still cold in me thermals, I felt right nesh, me A cold cuppa and another night of scraps and cold scran Not fit for beast or man, eating an all day breakfast from a tin can. Cold black pudding, brown as mud  Sucking squealing little piggies congealed blood  I didn't know if I were coming or going, tooing or throwing...up Half rice, half chips.... without the gravy Swirling head, ever so hazy I were frozzen so got back inside I put wood in hole and lit fire I thought about Murgatroyd the MONSTER  and how he would send his guns for hire",

I had a neb out of window. No one there.  Just those goodtime friends, the wind and rain... the sleet the ice. Murgatroyd must a been pretty ratty now. I knew he would have monk on. Everything mithered him, everything. I were glad I escaped, with all his brass. He'd be right chuffed if he could find me. Eee by eck. He'd be sure to give me a right good threpping. It were late that night when Harry and Christa broke me the news. Murgatroyd were on warpath, crazy, wild and full of booze I were flummoxed and tired of faffing about with this new gun But the warning signs were there. I better move and get on the run. I sneaked out, late it were.",

Your nuttin more than werehed up sticky Coney Island whitefish to me honey. A funny-faced fat-fuck running off with me money. Stop ringing that bell in me head like a third rate Shala-bubbala. Drinking dat yeller piss from another cheesy pink banana. Yeah you go skid-addle leaving me in a stream of shit without a paddle. I'm gonna find you! We aint gonna chew that fat! When I know where you are you aint gonna talk no more. You'll be screaming, mercy, mercy, mercy, with four on the floor.   I shoulda put you in the can house with all those other cheap bims. You can stop your yapping, soon yous gonna be Zotzed babe. Couple of bean shooters gonna appear out of the dark. A little bit of Chicago lightning, just for you kitten. Yeah you always go over the edge with the rams, ten to many eel juices. I betcha gowed-up again, and to think we used to drink from the same bottle. All this for a few berries this is gonna be so eggs in the coffee to me. I'm heeled baby, the high pillow a real Bruno. Watch out for the chopper squad! Killing you is gonna be duck soup to me! Another Harlem sunset! No croaker is gonna be able to put you back together. Just another red light from the rattler. Hitting the tracks in pieces Bye Bye Baby, baby bye bye. RUB OUT.

I got fire in me engine Stoking - Poking - Choking Steel wheels turning Stomach churning I can get out of this  To live another day To cry another night To make.....haste  They spot me, a brief encounter  I run, I load the gun Jones the steam and fat controller I set me sights down warm revolver Thomas and Ivor have found me trail I pick them off, it's easy as stamping on a snail Bang Bang  - you're dead Shoot Shoot - full of lead Clunk Click every trip Re-arm!

            "about": "This complete download version of MY LONG ACCUMULATING DISCONTENT contains the original 2004 mix of the album, an enhanced 2011 mix and 9 bonus tracks.\nThe 9 bonus remixed tracks were intended to come as an extra disc with the original album, this initial plan was later abandoned. This is the first time the complete remixes have been made available.\nThe enhanced 2011 mix is remastered and has been adapted into a binaural mix. The result of the binaural mix should spatially transcend normal stereo, since it can accurately reproduce the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in sound waves. Binaural recordings can convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead or above. Any set of headphones that provide good right and left channel isolation are sufficient to hear the immersive effects of the recording and anyone who has even a cheap set of headphones can enjoy these recordings.\nFor optimum listening experience in ‘3D’ you must use headphones. To enhance this listening experience it is recommended that you play back the enhanced mix in a dark room, eyes closed and with no exterior distractions.\n2004 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nBrainwashed\nThe most important and pleasing aspect of Andrew Liles' latest full-length is that it doesn't depend on any one formula, nor does it ever venture into the realm of total and complete chaotic madness. At times the music is wonderfully melodic, featuring ballroom-like music circa 1930s or 1940s and, at other times, it is an admixture blossoming with strange digital reverberations and analogue distortion. Most notably, however, My Long Accumulating Discontent features intelligible vocal parts and nearly unedited instrumental passages. His music is ever-expanding and finding new modes of existence. There is no sense here in talking about drones or noise. Though the music can be a collage of random samples and instruments at times, this record also features a queer and convincing logic that stems from its almost antique sound. Tracks like \"Dissolved (Te Whare Ao Aitu)\" and \"The Sour Accompaniment\" make a direct appeal to antiquity and play on the notion that these songs are all part of some morbid dream set far in the past; almost like Tim Burton's vision of America at the turn of the century. On the other hand, there are soft and fluid pieces such as \"The Children's Infirmary or Precious and Sugar Foot\" and \"A Cold Spring in Summerland\" that play off less familiar sounds and structures. While sounding distinct and perhaps more inviting than their musical neighbors, they ooze an aroma woven out of dust, old age, and memories better forgotten. I have an inkling of an idea that there is some form of a band environment behind these seventeen tracks—saxophones, nervous cymbals, melodic vocal parts, and narrative elements all play a part in various places—and there is, periodically, a very direct and uplifting song structure that stands out among the other pieces without being a show-stealer. I doubt Liles is forming a familiar band whatsoever, but the music that's ushered forth from his mind and those of the musicians used on this album is undoubtedly more structured and mesmerizing than anything else I've heard from him. Despite this, he's also managed to maintain the haunting, demonic, and perverse demeanor that makes his music so unique and alluring. It's the addition of new sounds and structures to his music plus his ability to manipulate those structures that make this record stand out so sharply in my collection. Songs like \"An Unkempt Garden or the Cod Cape\" and \"The Captain's Apprentice\" are the most emotionally stunning songs I've heard come from Liles and it is in their shape and movements that they become so remarkable. It's a shame that I missed this record in 2004, it deserves a great deal of attention as it is one of the most exciting records I've heard from the realm of all music subconscious and spectral. - Lucas Schleicher  www.brainwashed.com",

            "about": "THIS RECORDING IS NUMEROLOGICALLY ACCURATE AND ANAGRAMMATICALLY ACTIVE\n2004 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nVITAL WEEKLY\nAndrew Liles may be regarded as Infraction Records' stable artist, since 'New York Doll' is already his third release on the label. This new release is entirely based on concert recordings by Liles in the USA, UK, Sweden, France and the Czech Republic. These recordings are now chopped up and re-assembled at home. As I had the pleasure to see at least ten of his concerts in the USA, I know that Liles doesn't play the same tune every night, but rather has a few guidelines, a few sounds, that he mixes around when playing live. Sometimes the emphasis is more the synthesizer/ambient part, sometimes the taped sounds (people talking, girls singing, a telephone conversation) play the leading part. Still there is a great sense of inspiration from the likes of Nurse With Wound, but Liles nevertheless has a strong identity of his own. His collage work is set against a hybryd of drone related music, that can suddenly change mood and texture. It works quite intense at times. This double CD shows that Liles is also producer of great concert sounds. (FdW)\nDE:BUG\nOh, schon der dritte full-length release von Liles, den ich bisher verpaßt habe, dafür kommt jetzt aber eine schicke, dicke 2CD mit allerhand Sound-Abenteuern, die es zu enträtseln gilt. Denkt an die feuchte Musik von COH und wie sie versuchen, statt nach vorne zu treten, sich um die eigene Achse drehen, um sich schließlich im Niemandsland verlieren. Oder denkt an die Musik des großen Labels Die Stadt, verquert und angramatisiert, zerbeult, mit einem Schuß Coil und immer voll mannigfaltiger Pracht. Schwer zu sagen, was hier eigentlich wirklich passiert, aber gewiß ist, dass Liles' Stimmfetzen, seine goldenen Loops und die kristallinen drones eine Aufmerksamkeit einfordern, die so manch ähnliches Projekt als Lachnummer erscheinen lassen. Deep, very deep.\nEAR RATIONAL\nI have become quite a Liles fan in the past year, much to my happiness. Droney tones pulled long, like salt-water taffy, he doesn't take his music too seriously, this is obviously fun for him to create. And it is fun to listen to! Think Soliliqy for Lilith with about 1000 more things going on to keep it interesting, yet still as subtle and sublime as the Nurse With Wound album. Blended into the drones are interesting effects, like in the track on disc 1, Foreigner(but wait, there are 3 songs called Foreigner here!), you can hear scissors slicing back and forth, stereo-wise. Lots of mangled voices here, slowed down a little, other times sounding like they are coming out of a little velvet box in the corner. Other voices are in other languages, but my favorite part is when a women's voice just starts going off \"Blah blah blah bla blah.\" This 2 disc set has a porcelain doll on the cover and 50's stylings women on the interior. What New York Doll means, I don't know. A wonderful listen. I am happy to have this one!\nBRAINWASHED\nThe liner notes read, \"This recording is numerologically accurate and anagrammatically active.\" It's a journey from the recesses of the human mind to the world of words and sounds; Andrew Liles has resurrected his love for the anagram and created two discs of inverted uneasiness practically bathing in the dread and fear of every human psyche. If a model were to look into the mirror and see past all the make-up and fake admiration, he or she might see their face arranged into something dreadful, like the sounds Liles swoops up and twists into shimmering strands of crawling self-doubt. Beginning with a \"Journey\" and ending it in the same (but massively rethought) place, Liles deconstructs an already geographic puzzle of locations and ideas in order to reveal the parodies inherent within communication, thoughts, and recordings. Voices pan, distort, and stretch to their limits, connecting the seemingly empty space between aural recognition and the dead maze of concentrated mass that floats through the soul of the drone. New York Doll has been around for awhile, now, and as much as I love Liles' work, I've been absolutely afraid of this piece. All the loose ends and contradictory paths lurching beneath the electric activity of the mind are pieced and sewn together on this record. The entire album reeks of a discomfort that places my head in a discrete and incredibly uncomfortable position, much like viewing the whole of an enigma, which simultaneously does and does not make sense. I've found myself listening to this record more out of curiosity than out of enjoyment and, with but the second disc excluded, much of what Liles has done on this full-length feels more like a puzzle than a record. The notes on the sleeve, the titles of the songs, the hauntingly robotic words, and the general ghastliness all add up to a kind of riddle, beseeching me to move around inside of the album and find its bones, discover its DNA, and finally unravel it in a self-destructive fit. The album pans between consistent tones, clicks, static, and eerie atmospheres composed of pianos, telephones, and urban pandemonium. Never confident than any one approach will exact the necessity of his paranoia, Liles fills this album up with all the conspiracy and awkward connection of the most damning philosophical theories. After finishing the record it is impossible to deny that everything is connected by necessity, a limb of some central organism throbbing and decaying, pulsing through every heartbeat and uttered word in human and animal history. There is something waiting in the spaces between this album and its the most unnerving portrait of the soul he's yet to conceive. Even as recognizable voices fill the stereo spectrum on the second disc, Liles is laughing at the opinion that it must be terrestrial, of this world, and not some product of the mind extracting itself from nothing. - Lucas Schleicher",

            "about": "In 2008 I heard that Andrew W.K. was producing an album by Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry. I knew Andrew through his contributions both live and in the studio with Current 93. So being a fan of ‘Scratch’ I pleaded to be sent the multi-tracks so that I could make my own ‘dub’ mix purely for my own entertainment. I ditched all the existing music and recorded my own, then added Mr. Perry’s voice. I sent the results back to Andrew who seemed to like them at the time and there was some talk of releasing the mix some day, alas that day never arrived. Years later I remixed those remixes, removed any sign of Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry (for copyright reasons) and added a further 3 ‘dub’ mixes to an album called ‘Ninki Nanka, Yumboes & Monsters’.\nVocals by Maude Swift and Steve Pittis.\nDESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "Originally released as a CD by Dirter Promotions in 2008.\nREVIEW\nBrainwashed\nWritten by John Kealy\nSunday, 11 January 2009\nWasting little time, Diana Rogerson is back with another album of unhinged and gloomy psychedelica. Aided this time by Andrew Liles, this album shows a marked difference to her previous releases. While some of the pieces are surprisingly accessible and (dare I say it) musical, the harder edges of this album are made of a far different material than the scratchy creepiness of Chrystal Belle Scrodd. This impressive album sees Rogerson shed the soft cocoon of A Bad Diana and bear her claws for the first time in ages.\nNo Birds Do Sing is a much more raucous affair compared to 2007’s The Lights Are On But No-one’s Home. The music thumps hard and constantly sounds like it is going to implode under its own energy. Rogerson gives what is arguably the best vocal performance of her career. She completely lets loose, swinging between a sultry devil on “Can I Tempt You With All This?” and a screeching harpy on “Should the Prayer Wheel Turn.” This sometimes makes for a difficult listen as she give such a pained performance that, much like Diamanda Galás, even though the pieces are incredibly good, they are too draining to listen to as often as I would like. Referencing the title of her last album, when she utters “I’m so scared because I’m still not, I’m still not at home,” it gives me the chills.\nMusically, Liles brings with him the eclecticism of his other collaborations (there are shades of Fini!, his album with Faust’s Jean-Hervé Peron on the rockier parts of this album). The almost funky drum beats and keyboards of “Can I Tempt You With All This?” and its later sister track stand out in contrast to the exotic rhythms and instrumentation of the other pieces. There seems to be a move away from the Nurse With Wound moods and sounds explored by Rogerson with her Chrystal Belle Scrodd and A Bad Diana albums (perhaps due to Steven Stapleton taking a backseat here, providing only “post production consultation” and artwork). This has resulted in a freakier sounding album than any other NWW-related release I have heard. The uneasy Middle Eastern “Ever Afflicted With” is haunting and hypnotic, creating an unsettling mood that is then exacerbated by the pulsing, tribal beat of “Ki Denga Pepo.” Rogerson’s cries are merged with those of a baby for a truly disturbing experience.\nRogerson and Liles have put together a remarkable album. No Birds Do Sing is difficult without being completely obtuse yet at times it is also conversely one of Rogerson’s and/or Liles’ most accessible albums. It pushes and pulls the listener around like a rag doll; just when I feel I am going to break the duo relent for a moment, allowing a breather to recover. It makes for an exciting listening experience.",

                    "lyrics": "OHRWURM The Germans, in all innocence, came up with the word: Ohrwurm. Earworm. An inanely catchy song or jingle that will not leave your consciousness no matter how much you dislike it. In the final years of capitalist civilisation, earworms of a very different kind arose. Earworms of a lethal disposition. Early clues to the impending apocalypse were subtle and easy to miss. A few hundred people in different cities dying of unexplained causes. So what?  Humans are temperamental mechanisms and they expire for inexplicable reasons all the time. Many death certificates are sheer conjecture. The fact that Mrs Whatserface from down the road had grown increasingly confused and then dropped dead was a matter for gossip, not existential panic. But when the numbers soared – when the dead began to choke the morgues and disfigure the shopping malls – it was belatedly understood that a new plague had come into the world. Autopsies became more focused, pathologists stopped wasting time and energy on blameless organs like the heart, stomach, lungs and liver. The brain was where the evil was done. Slice open the brain, cleave the hemispheres apart, and you would find creatures that should not be there – louse-like parasites whose minuscule mouths were crammed with grey matter. The brain-eaters had arrived to exterminate mankind. The cause? Sexual immorality, said the fundamentalists. Food additives, said the health freaks. Poison in the water supply, argued the conspiracy theorists. An extraterrestrial virus, suggested the Sci-Fi geeks. All these possibilities and more were investigated by an increasingly desperate confederacy of scientists and physicians, themselves prey, like everyone else, to sudden death from the disease. After exhaustive tests, the earworms were finally traced back to their source: the mobile telephone. Of course, the possibility that mobile phones were carcinogenic had been mooted for years, but the target of suspicion – whether by scientists or paranoid cranks – had been the radiation. Crackpots love radiation because it is invisible yet harmful, a combination that thrills their conspiracy-addled brains. Scientists love radiation because it can be measured. They can point out that the rotations of molecules induced by the mobile’s electromagnetic field raise the temperature of the human head by only a fraction of a degree, less than would be achieved by the sun coming out from behind the clouds. Whereupon the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz – the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection – declares itself unconvinced, and insists that more research needs to be done. All this kerfuffle and claptrap – all this discussion of thermoreceptors and watts per gramme – was barking up the wrong tree, of course. The true danger posed by mobile phones was not in the signals they emitted nor anything to do with their function. It was, like most deadly evils, organic in origin. Encased within the shiny carapaces of these devices, in tiny but significant quantities, lurked a complex ecosystem of minerals and chemicals – mercury, lithium, lead, arsenic, beryllium, tantalum, cadmium, zinc, antimony, polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, brominated flame retardant, as well as dozens of trace elements from the exotic soils of Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi and Guangdong. It was these ingredients, combined with microscopic motes of skin, sweat and body oil from the flesh of the phone users, that bred the deadly organisms. The innards of the telephone functioned, in fact, like a miniature android laboratory, an experimental environment dedicated to conceiving and nurturing the smallest form of life. The organisms proliferated as invisible mites which penetrated the pink flesh of the phone user’s earlobes, and then burrowed deeper into the head, eventually making their home in the spongy cauliflower of the brain, growing into slender, translucent grubs. The earworms fed frugally, keen to maintain a viable host-parasite relationship, but the relationship tended to last only a few months before there was more worm than brain and the host expired in terrifying fits of delirium. Among the most troubling of symptoms of earworm infestation was palinacousis, an auditory affliction in which the sufferer, upon hearing a sound, continued to hear that sound over and over and over, despite there being no repetition in acoustic reality. In extreme cases, people whose heads echoed ceaselessly with the most maddening noises – the squeak of faulty furniture, the barking of neurotic dogs, the slimy croon of Spandau Ballet’s ‘True’– were driven to suicide. A false dawn of hope came two years into the epidemic, when it was discovered that one group of people were apparently immune to the earworm: cat lovers. It appeared that the ownership of a feline conferred a mysterious immunity. Dogs, rabbits and hamsters didn’t cut the mustard: it had to be cats. Of course, once this was known, there was a desperate rush on cat ownership. Every manky stray, every kitten hitherto destined for drowning, every old and ugly shelter-dweller mouldering on Euthanasia Row, was snatched into the bosom of needy families. Bankers and stockbrokers who had plundered billions without the slightest interference from the law were shocked to find themselves legally prevented from buying up cats in bulk. Each citizen was allowed just one. Rap stars, R&B bimbos and other celebrities, accustomed to provoking heightened adulation in their fans by vulgar displays of wealth and privilege, procured cats for each of their swarm of servants and hangers-on, but quickly discovered that the reaction of the public to such flaunting of feline excess was not starstruck envy but righteous rage. Pampered divas were found murdered in their mansions or even dragged from their limos by chanting mobs. Before long, the rich learned to be discreet about their cats. Pretentiousness about cat brands went out the window, too: formerly shameless snobs adjusted their standards so that a lowly tabby was as good as a Persian purebred. The middle classes, meanwhile, waited in line for each litter of fresh kittens, and read with anxious interest the news reports (possibly merely rumours) of cat farms where an animal could be reared from rodent-like newborn to fluffy adult in 72 hours. There were reports too (again, possibly rumours) that legions of abandoned dogs were being rounded up, slaughtered and processed for cat food, whose sales had increased fiftyfold. In the post-earworm landscape, no one would admit to disliking cats anymore; it would be tantamount to disliking antibiotics or plasma. As for the gluten-free soymilk drinkers who had once declared that they were allergic to pets, they eagerly buried their faces in the abdominal fur of their new pussies as though indulging in trans-species cunnilingus. The irony of all this brand-new cat love – as epidemic as the epidemic itself – was that it was totally ineffective against the disease. Only long-term, leisurely exposure to the feline antibodies, absorbed through the skin molecule by molecule over a period of years before the advent of the earworm, had the desired effect. It was prophylaxis, not cure. If you had always loved cats, your love had inoculated you; if your affection was new and cynical, you could stroke the fur as much as you wished, you could sleep with your cheek on the cat’s flank, you could submit to the creature’s raspy tongue on your knuckles or the smell of kitty litter on your thighs, and none of it would stop the earworms eating your head.",

            "about": "This recording was created to mark my 45th year on the 11th of March 2014.\nIn conjunction with this download release was a 7″ test pressing, housed in screen printed sleeve with stamped labels in an edition of 45 copies.\nThe download has 11 tracks all of which are 4 minutes and 5 seconds in length aside from the last track which is 4 minutes 10 seconds long. The total running time is 45 minutes, being a contrived reference to my age. The majority of track times (4.05) are a further allusion to my age and the number of tracks (11) being my date of birth.\nThe 7″ has remixed versions of track 6 on the A side and track 9 on the flip side, representing (19)69 – which denotes the year I was born. The overdubs used on these mixes were created by an i-Pad version of the VCS 3 synthesizer. The original VCS 3 was created by the Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd. (EMS) and issued in 1969 (again, another reference to the year of my birth).\nThe download comprises of 11 tracks that were made on an i-Pad using a virtual ANS synthesizer. The images imported or drawn on to the synth were all references to either my date of birth, age, significant places and my name.\nI used the ANS sound specifically for the reason that it has the name ‘Ans’, which in French translates as years. The word ‘years’ being a reference to the concept behind this recording.\nMARCH 2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "This complete download of ‘SOMNAMBULANCE TO DREAM GENERAL’ was remastered in 2011. It features 6 extra tracks that were not included on either the original CDR or CD re-release editions.\n‘SOMNAMBULANCE TO DREAM GENERAL’ was originally compiled for an excursion to the USA in June 2006 and was initially released in an edition of 100 CDRs. It was later released as a CD on Klanggalerie as GG109 with 3 extra tracks in 2007.\nFour of the additional tracks included in this download version are from the now long deleted E.P. ‘THE GAZOGENE MACHINES, SEIDLITZ POWDERS, BRUISING ROOTS & RHIZOMES E.P’. This 7” was released in an edition of 100 copies as GG90 on Klanggalerie in 2004. Reinstated in this version is the last 12 seconds of ‘The Venomous Shrew or Sweeping Sooterkins’ that for some unknown reason was cut from the original vinyl pressing.\n‘Fictional, Arrogant and Sometimes Insulting’ is a previously unreleased archive recording from 2006.\n‘Insidious, Importunate Suggestions of Impropriety’ is a previously unreleased extended version of ‘Importunate Suggestions of Impropriety’ that appeared in an edition of 35 copies on wax cylinder in 2010.\nMany thanks to Walter Robotka at Klanggalerie.\n2006 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "NOTES BY ANDREW LILES\nThe machine this 'music' is made on is the Open NSynth Super. I call\nmine the A.U.M.M - the Artificially Unintelligent Monster Maschine. Basically, you can add one or more instruments to each corner of the machine, and where one places one's finger on the X Y pad in the centre determines the amount of blending between the instruments.\nFor example, you could assign a piano sound in the left corner and guitar in the right corner. If you placed your finger on the left corner you would hear only piano. If you were to place your finger on the right corner you would hear only guitar. If you were to place your finger in-between the left and right you would hear half guitar and half piano, thus creating a hybrid instrument - the Piatar if you will. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), through very intense and data heavy calculations, determines what it 'thinks' the Piatar should sound like.\nA traditional composer would, I presume, have instruments tuned to be in harmony with one another; synced, tuned, clean and complimentary sounds.\nI'm not a traditional composer, arguably not a composer at all, so I decided that each note would be a different sound. I chose 128/256 random and not so random sounds - all kinds of tuned sounds and sound effects. The AI would in turn process these sounds in such a way so that I could theoretically create an 'illogical' instrument with no musical scale or distinct hybrid 'instrument' but many different\npermutations, each note played on the keyboard being its own instrument.\nI wanted to design a machine that had no logic and that would not create a formal musical structure. I wanted the AI to invent tones that had never been heard before. A universe of sound reinvented by the computer's dreams and imagination.\nThe sounds you hear on this recording are made entirely by the NSynth machine learning algorithm. I have used a sparing amount of EQ, stereo effects, reverb and echo to smooth out the sounds. The music is played by me, and the raw sounds fed into NSynth are chosen by me, but other than that, all the sounds you are hearing come from the imagination of a computer.\nAUDIO QUALITY\nDue to the limitations and format of the files that are used for the NSynth, this recording may, in part, lack some fidelity.\nTECHNICAL NOTES BY ANDREW BACK\nTo quote its creators, 'NSynth uses deep neural networks to generate sounds at the level of individual samples. Learning directly from data, NSynth provides artists with intuitive control over timbre and dynamics,\nand the ability to explore new sounds that would be difficult or impossible to produce with a hand-tuned synthesizer.'\nThe NSynth algorithm is far too computationally intensive to be run in\nreal-time or indeed on anything but a reasonably powerful computer. In\nthis case a workstation equipped with 2x Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPUs,\ntogether capable of over 22 trillion calculations per second, was used.\nWith 4x instruments per corner and 16 notes/pitches each, it took just\nshort of 3 days for the algorithm to run, in total generating over\n10,000 audio files for the many different combinations of input sounds\nand the interpolation points between them, and pitch.\nOnce the artificially generated sounds had been created they were loaded onto the Open NSynth Super, which provides a physical interface for navigating the sounds that exist in between the sounds input to NSynth.\n2018 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

I am eternally grateful for his technical skills and the time he has dedicated to this experiment.\nAndrew Back has been making and breaking electronics for as long as he can remember, he runs an engineering consultancy, and is an occasional artist -  andrewback.net",

(this) scattergun approach proved successful, despite his reviews of non-sequitirs and non-sensical cyberspeak being interchangeable\" [discogs.com]. after all was said and done he'd put out fifteen total albums, including three that are on net labels and are availiable to download for free at smell the stench and dystonia. the bulk of them have been in the form of collaborations, most notably with gx jupitter-larsen (the haters), torturing nurse and henrik nordvargr björkk (hh9, folkstorm, mz.412, et al.). i would be surprised if that last one is anything short of amazing. i...must...stop...buying...things...\nblack paper opens up with barometer ii, a beautifully haunting piano piece by liles, which siratori soon begins speaking over. his words are all spoken in japanese. emphasis on spoken. this could be poetry or god knows what, but it sounds great. he's got this gruff sounding voice that immediately made me think of splinter's voice from the teenage mutant ninja turtles movies. i love it. there's some great layering of his vocals near the end, too.\nvtr is one of the least musical (most experimental) cuts on here. there's a whole mess of noises, electronic bleeps and textures from andrew, and kenji's vocals are affected, in parts, and panned all over. it easily has the most overall stuff going on at once, but it works well, due partly to how andrew progresses it. if that was the album's exercise in maximalism (i think i just made that word up), the title piece is its most rhythmic. half of this piece features with some very catchy xylophone (i'm guessing) playing, the rest focuses on kenji's vocals, manipulated the most here. one of my favorite parts is where its just him with no music, and there's also his sped up vocals shooting back and forth between the speakers.\njaguar is black paper's absolute highlight. over liles' sparse backdrop there's a vocal track in the left speaker, a different one in the right, a repetitious one in the center and then another, different track in the center. it's completely hypnotic, wonderful and memorable. then when that piano comes in towards the end, jaguar achieves total brilliance. it all strikes me as being rather noir, while maintaining an underlying sense of beauty. the next two tracks mainly feature andrew doing some nice, slightly stark, experimental electronic work. the closer, barometer iii is vocal less and revises the pianos from barometer ii, but adds some terrific electronic noises over it.\nthere's actually two separate collaborations by kenji siratori with the title black paper, the other is with tardive dyskinesia. that may cause a bit of confusion, but this one is only available from andrew liles' website or beta-lactam ring. it's part of andrew's 12 cd set, the vortex vault, limited to only 300 copies. once those 300 are gone, that's it. no reissues. i think if you get one from andrew it will be signed by him.\ni'd also recommend his collaboration with gx. while it's not as memorable as this one here, there's some mighty fine noise by him, and who doesn't like mighty fine noise? after hearing all of this from kenji i've definitely become interested in his literary work...at the very least it should be interesting.\nVital Weekly\n...The Vortex Vault series, a series of no less than 12 CD's of both archive and new recordings plus the odd collaboration thrown in. On Black Paper he collaborates with Japanese artist Kenji Siratori, who contributes spoken word and whisperings, delivered in an urgent and dynamic fashion. As my Japanese is poor, I have no idea what he's talking about, making the voice sound more like an additional instrument, which perfectly suits Liles' collage-like style of music. Black Paper is a great CD (though at 30 minutes a bit brief), which made me want to listen to the second Liles CD in this series even more.\nRE:GEN Magazine\nAndrew Liles' new series of CDs, The Vortex Vault, is as ambitious and eclectic as the composer himself, including everything from archival releases to new collaborations spread out over 12 CDs. The first part is a collaboration with Kenji Siratori, the prolific and avant-garde author who's recently risen to prominence in the industrial scene by working with everyone from Portion Control to Nordvargr. On Black Paper, the first impression you get from Siratori is one of intensity; whether or not you understand Japanese, his growled speech on opening track \"Barometer II\" sounds angry and threatening. \"VTR\" is less emotional but no less unsettling; like Siratori's writing, it's cold and mechanical, with Liles' sampled mechanical sounds making things even more jarring. \"Jaguar,\" on the other hand, is almost tranquil in places, with Liles building soft atmospheres by looping and layering Siratori's monologues and smoothing them over with judicious sustain effects. Perhaps the most intriguing piece, though, is the title track. A bit like Einstürzende Neubauten's quieter \"floor pieces,\" it builds a gentle rhythm from clattering metal, with melodic accents provided by what sounds like a xylophone. Though its sound sources—including Siratori's muttered monologue, which pans back and forth across the stereo channels—its use of at least some structure makes the arrangements all the more uncanny. Between Liles' own sonic eccentricities and the fact that few English-speaking listeners speak Japanese, Black Paper is by definition of interest only to a select few, but for fans of the avant-garde it appears that The Vortex Vault is off to a good start.\nPosted: Wednesday, July 25, 2007\nBy: Matthew Johnson\nAssociate Editor\nBizarre Magazine\nConsisting of 12 individually released CDs, this is, in part, a collection of unreleased material from one of the UK's finest electronic experimentalists' studio archives. A collaborator with similar sound envelope-pushers such as Nurse With Wound and The Hafler Trio, Liles' music mixes minimalist drones with antique instrumentation and natural noise for a sonically surreal sound. This is dark ambience in its most eclectic form - sublime, sinister and visually spectacular.\nBy Billy Chainsaw\nVital Weekly\nBlack Hole has Liles all on his own. Much more contemplative by nature, this 14 track CD is less outspoken than Black Paper. The 40+ minutes of Liles-material, full of loops, found sounds and strange effects, will surely please his ever-growing army of fans. In fact, interest so far in the Andrew Liles' Vortex Vault series has been so high, that BLRR has made it possible to buy the whole set in one go at a reduced price. Highly recommended!\nRE:GEN Magazine\nPart Two of The Vortex Vault series of random and archival tracks from experimental composer Andrew Liles, Black Hole features a little bit of everything. For fans of ambient and drone music, \"An Uneventful Afternoon\" is a gentle drift on warm analog tones, and \"Humiliated\" is a strange but enjoyable bit of '70s-style space rock synths. \"Midnight Gardener\" is quite interesting too; its core consists of distant church bells ringing through a thickened bank of sustain, while muffled conversations playing back and forth across the stereo channels conjure the feeling of waking up from a winter nap to the sound of passersby talking as they pass your window. For slightly more industrial-tinged fare, try the echoing clanks of \"Pillow Voice\" or the panning buzzes and muffled percussion of \"Root Canal,\" which—perhaps thanks to the Novocaine haze of the coolly droning background effects—is far less painful than its title suggests. Alternately, \"Without Anaesthesia\" is aptly sadistic, thanks to a shrieking noise that may be metal on metal but may in fact be actual shrieking, but not without its funky charm, thanks to a mellow tribal rhythm. While a lot of this is playful but somewhat inaccessible, actual melodies do make the occasional appearance as well. \"Hello Pharaoh\" sets a man's voice humming absentmindedly in harmony with a lovely wordless soprano, and \"Bad Vibes Waiting Room\" pairs buzzing upright bass with tinkling vibraphone, like some coffeehouse jazz duo filtered through post-industrial surrealism. It's a good collection of tracks, all things considered; Liles' devoted fans will enjoy the variety of course, but perhaps more importantly, newcomers will get a chance to sample a variety of his unconventional flavors in small, easily-digested chunks.\nPosted: Wednesday, July 25, 2007\nBy: Matthew Johnson\nAssociate Editor\nClassical Drone\nBlack Hole is perhaps the most conventional of the three, thirteen short instrumentals. Liles doesn't use as much reverb and other effects as many ambient artists, even on his \"ambient\" pieces (such as An Uneventful Afternoon), which gives the album a more human touch, not as many machines taking the various musician roles. Often there is a simple melody line, repeated over and over, with other instruments or noises in the background. Bad Vibes Waiting Room, for example, uses something like a bass guitar to play a simple two-bar melody, with occasional melodic and textural variations throughout. He combines this melody with vibes and some very spare noises. Three minutes and it's over, without wearing itself out or spinning out to something new. This pattern affords considerable variety, whether he uses loops from old records (Hello Pharoah), melodramatic soap-opera gestures on electric organ (Sequential Dreaming) or even sequencers that wouldn't be out of place on a Klaus Schulze album (Humiliated). The tunes range from soft drones (An Unspoken Narrative Regarding Institutional Abuse) all the way to a semi-African jungle rhythm (Without Anaesthesia). Because each piece is so short, the album almost seems like a sketch book, which is of course the theme of the Vortex Vault as a whole.\nRE:GEN MAGAZINE\nFor its centerpiece, Part Three of Andrew Liles' collection of rarities features two extended experiments in ambient music and found sound. The first, \"All Things Bright and Beautiful and Corrosive,\" is as bleak as its title suggests, and as varied. Starting off with quiet ambient drones, creaks, and occasional tapping sounds, it also features slowly echoing gongs and washed out crashes of cymbals. For its second movement, soft chimes slip into the mix, adding a sort of creepy music box vibe vaguely reminiscent of Coil's early work, and the emphasis on random and unexpected sound effects calls to mind Nurse With Wound. \"George the Chemist\" is less eclectic, but perhaps also less unsettling, with softly ringing tones evoking the subtle loneliness of Tor Lundvall or Raison D'etre. It's the scattering of short pieces on Black Beauty though, that prove to be most compelling. Each a quick experiment in melody, they run the gamut from beatnik weirdness on the rain stick-soaked jazz wails of \"Dead Roses\" to the Tim Burton chiming of \"Tender Box.\" Each is long enough to present a thought, but short enough to leave you wanting more; the eerie dulcimers of \"A Numbers Game\" in particular would make a good basis for a longer piece. \"The Artless Shaman,\" on the other hand, is perfect just the way it is; any more of its mellow tribal beats and puzzled, puzzling growls, and the fun would be ruined. And Black Beauty is, most importantly, a fun CD; it has its dark places, but Liles' passion for extravagantly weird music comes through even in its bleakest moments.\nPosted: Wednesday, July 25, 2007\nBy: Matthew Johnson\nAssociate Editor\nClassical Drone\nThings take a decidedly weird turn on the third volume, Black Beauty. For one, although there are still a couple of short tracks that would have fit nicely on Black Hole, there are two much longer tracks, each clocking in at sixteen minutes. In addition, some of the music is considerably more abstract here. The opening track, Dead Roses, is a wispy electroacoustic piece, with a couple of instrumental reference points with some percussion and a few trumpet licks, but which otherwise would fit comfortably with some of the more subdued work of the French-Canadian acousmaticists on the Empreintes Digitales label. On the longer tracks, he has time to show how his drones and melodies transform themselves into each other over time. For example, on All Things Bright and Beautiful and Corrosive, percussion scrapings and boomings with extended resonance mingle with garbled and otherwise treated vocal sounds, finally joining with a melodic loop played on a gamelan. The other long track, George the Chemist, uses slow loops combined with more constant and ominous drones, with a loop played on flute and percussion floating in the middle.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Matthew Amundsen\nSunday, 01 April 2007\nThe latest installment to spill from Andrew Liles' ambitious and generous Vortex Vault series casts Liles as the ringleader of a black magic vaudeville act. Theatrical and playfully whimsical, this multilingual, dialogue-laden album is a striking release that shifts modes effortlessly, revealing new finds from Liles' unlimited bag of tricks at every turn. The human voice, both speaking and singing, forms an integral part of this album. The unpredictable way it's interspersed with music and the different languages that appear and vanish gives the impression that there’s some bizarre stage performance in progress, even if I'm at a loss to explain what it's about. The vocals range from the spoken word to the operatic, and the effect is jarring only when it’s intentional.\nMusically, there are plenty of fascinating objects to behold in this cabinet of curiosities. \"Bengali Bergman\" has dirge-like strings and a beguiling Eastern accompaniment. Hand drums make up a large part of \"Quicksand Mudslide\" as some feline entity patrols the border. This piece is interrupted by startling electrical zaps as if some modern alchemical wizard is channeling the secret energy of the universe. It‘s one of the most arresting moments on the disc. Also surprising, albeit in a different sense altogether, is the song \"God Doesn’t Fuck About,\" a percussive jazz funk so convincing that I momentarily forgot what album I was listening to until the airplane rush of an ending reminded me.\nAlthough a few recurring titles appear sporadically throughout the album, they are not simply multiple versions of the same song. Instead, they are different enough from each other to suggest they are somehow parts of a related story or theme, even though the instrumentation and mood are often dissimilar. Yet it's a tactic that works in the service of the unexpected.\nThe breadth of this album and its beautiful presentation really make it an impressive package. Even the devilishly genial hand-puppet shadow grinning on the cover reflects the fun to be found within. Liles and Beta-lactam Ring are raising the bar ever higher with this series, and they both deserve a lot of credit for making these incredible recordings available.\nVITAL WEEKLY\nThis is the fourth release in a total of 12 CDs in the Black Series by Liles, current member of Nurse With Wound and general magic man. Like the previous CDs in this series, Liles uses more and more vocals in his music, which complement his music wonderfully. On this disc famous actor/singer Ernesto Tomasini (who also appeared on Crowded Skies on the BBC television) adds narration and sings. There is even narration in Urdu (by Dr. Malik). Starting off with the thumbpiano of To Maim A Donkey we are sucked into the surrealist world of Liles, where things are never quite what they seem. Strange samples and dark sounds creep in and out\nand are laced with a unique sense of humur (as in A Hippo Took An Apricot). Before you know it, you're humming along to The cod-James Bond theme And God Doesn't Fuck About, before you realize it's just a little off-beat (and definitely off-set!). The best issue of the Black Series so far, this CD is highly recommended. (FK)\nRE:GEN MAGAZINE\nPart Four in The Vortex Vault series ongoing series of rarities and collaborative works, Black Widow sees Andrew Liles bringing in a couple of guest vocalists: Urdu professor Dr. Malik and Italian cult performer Ernesto Tomasini. An eclectic mixture of Urdu, Italian, and English draws the album together in a loose thematic arrangement, while Liles' arrangements and studio work ensure an ongoing sense of eclecticism. Instrument choices range from primitive to classical; \"To Maim a Donkey, Part I\" starts things off with a bit of thumb piano, but just as you prepare yourselves for an exploration of African themes, \"Bengali Bergman\" takes things in a radically different direction, merging the classical traditions of East and West in the form of sitar and cello. Voice also plays a prominent role; \"Uncle Alf\" is a mysterious little narrative piece—like a Ligotti short story, it's somehow both innocuous and chilling—set to gently ringing ambient tones, for example, and \"Dove I (Noodles and Cheese)\" layers Italian speech over humming vibraphone. Only one selection, \"To Maim a Donkey, Part III,\" is built around actual singing in the conventional sense. It's a sort of operatic nugget about... well, maiming a donkey. Conceptually, it should be offensive to opera fans and donkeys alike, but in practice, it's ridiculous enough that only the most humorless and ardent supporters of either could possibly take umbrage. Lyrics aside, Tomasini's vocal range on the piece is uncanny; he sings both the English and Italian parts, in tenor and falsetto, respectively, and sounds for all the world like two separate people. Dr. Malik's contributions, on the other hand, are dry and rather mumbling, but this too is surprisingly effective in places; \"Dove II (Hoodle on a Plinth)\" is particularly gorgeous. With nothing more than quiet speech and understated pianos, it achieves a subtle loveliness that recalls Current 93's Soft Black Stars crossed with a Punjabi graduate school seminar. At first listen, there's not a lot holding these tracks together, but Tomasini's campy performance and Malik's businesslike narration manage to pull things together in an unlikely cohesion. In any case, it provides further fuel for thought to Liles' already eccentric output and makes a welcome addition to The Vortex Vault.\nPart Six of The Vortex Vault sticks mostly to classically-inspired ambient, but it wouldn't be an Andrew Liles album without a surprise or two. The sixth entry in The Vortex Vault, Andrew Liles' collection of random pieces and outtakes, Black Sea sticks mainly to dark, minimalist soundscapes drawing on various classical traditions. \"Anhedonia\" opens things with an extensive creepy meditation, starting off with the cold reverberations of mournful choir singing, but then moves into a surrealist spoken-word piece, with a man teaching a child to memorize by repetition such evocative yet bizarre phrases as \"These are not angels, these are hovering flies\" and \"We are alone with Walnut Mary.\" It's at once nonsensical and completely chilling. \"Olisbos (Introduced Instruments into the Belly of Another)\" and \"Padavona (The Long Running Dispute Over the D.O.B. of R.J.D.)\" are each instrumental snippets barely longer than their titles, the first built around the scraping gypsy violin of Annie Kerr and the second centering on a moody piano phrase. Finishing things up is the title piece, presented in three parts in descending order. \"Black Sea, Part III (A Return to the Bottom of the Ocean)\" is dark ambient, crafted of studio-manipulated choir pads, their attack and decay lengthened extensively and drenched in sustain. With its tidal washes of soft fuzz, it's like a less ghostly take on Salt Marie Celeste by Nurse With Wound, with whom Liles is a frequent collaborator and live performer. \"Black Sea, Part II (Danny Buoy)\" is more dissonant and industrial, with lots of slow rumbles and metal scrapes, though it eventually adds piano and a reprise of Kerr's violins. Then, is if to call the quiet avant-garde classical of the rest of the album into question, \"Black Sea, Part I (Semen, Salt, Sweat, Blood, Semen)\" bursts forth from waves breaking softly upon a sandy beach into a noisy grind of instrumental garage rock, overloaded and overdriven. It's more like a Black Sabbath outtake than anything else on Black Sea, but it's also a fine example of what makes Liles such an intriguing noise artist. You can't ever rely on what he's done in the past as a predictor of what he might do in the future. That would be a curse if he was playing pop music, but it's a blessing for fans of the weird.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Matthew Amundsen\nSunday, 05 August 2007\nAnother bewitching album to waltz from the Vortex Vault, this one evokes cinematic imagery if only because there is less of a focus on vocals here and more emphasis on atmosphere. One of the best things about Liles' music is how it sparks the imagination beyond the scope of intention, and Black Market is no exception.\nLiles' use of the sustained piano is a common thread running through many of the entries in the Vortex Vault, and his use of it in the opener \"Malcolm\" could be an invocation of the rest of the series. The piano also figures prominently on a couple of other tracks, including \"He Always Worked, He Never Hit Me,\" the wistful melody of which reveals a little more emotion than some of his other solo piano works.\n\"Robotic Monkey\" especially made me think in cinematic terms as it could easily be the soundtrack to a long-lost David Lynch outtake with garbled, guttural speech underlying a mystery-laden jazz score. Equally intriguing is \"A Little Adventure After Dark,\" in which an appealing rhythm made from what could be the striking of high-tension wires and additional reverb clanks around for a while until a light keyboard melody arrives to complement the movement and is eventually joined by horns for the finale. I was also captivated by \"Taking Bumblebee to France for the Afternoon,\" a gossamer fugue that ends with the sound of an airplane flying away, as well as \"Time Waits For No Man,\" a droning instrumental with sinister undertones. Since I am both allergic to bananas and lactose intolerant, I have to admit a fondness for the title, \"Matthew Doesn't Like Bananas In His Ice Cream.\" Thankfully, the song itself is much more enjoyable than my own boring trivia as its heavy, wavering tones are eventually relieved by a hallucinatory airy passage. Liles ends the album on a different note altogether from which it started with \"Black Grass.\" Here he unleashes his krautrock impulses in a slowly unfolding hypnotic rocker that's one of the album's longer tracks. There are only two songs on the album with discernable vocals, and both are effective counterpoints to the instrumentals that populate the rest of the album. The first is \"36-23-33 1/2,\" with numerical narration by Alexander Thynn, the seventh Marquess of Bath, who also provided narration on Mother Goose's Melody. On \"Anhedonia (Part 3),\" Tony Wakeford contributes world-weary vocals over the top of Liles's sparse, brooding piano.\nWhile there are certainly some similarities among the different entries in the Vortex Vault series, each one has its own unique share of surprises. One of the great qualities of these recordings is that Liles can go from moody abstraction to playful structured material and make the transition seem natural, if not inevitable. His juxtaposition of different styles and the confluence of radically divergent ideas make his work vital, no matter what form it may take.\nRE:GEN MAGAZINE\nPosted: Friday, November 02, 2007\nBy: Matthew Johnson\nThe second half of Andrew Liles' ambitious 12-album collection of random tracks, outtakes, and collaborations begins with this offering of short sketches.Several of the albums in The Vortex Vault have seemed more like actual albums than collections of rarities and discards, but Andrew Liles kicks off the second half of the ambitious 12-disc series with a pile of tracks that, while intriguing, don't have a lot holding them together. \"Malcolm\" starts things off with deep moody piano chords, then \"Robotic Monkey\" takes things in a jazzier direction with bouncing saxophones and upright bass. \"Taking Bumblebee to France for the Afternoon\" embodies its title perfectly with sunny layers of fuzzed out brass and a soaring jet engine. Fortunately, the music on \"Undiluted Puce Diarrhoea\" is less directly related to its title, consisting of minimalist ringing tones, and the echoing cymbals and soft harps of \"Horsehair and Milk\" are more pleasant than such a concoction has any right to be. \"Anhedonia (Part 3)\" sees Liles reprise a track from the previous CD in the series, this time adding Tony Wakeford of Sol Invictus, who delivers the song's surrealist phrases (\"We are alone with Walnut Mary\") in his usual dour baritone. Generally speaking, Liles' work alternates between disturbing and playful, and Black Market offers plenty of both, ranging from the eerie darkness of \"Time Waits for No Man\" to the tinkling IDM of \"The Jean Michel and Vangelis Taboo Liaison,\" an inside joke for those with electronic music obsessions if there ever was one. There's even a nod to Krautrock on the hypnotic psychedelic guitar strums of \"Black Grass.\" The downside of all this variety though, is that it's really only going to appeal to people already familiar with Liles and his work. If you're going to journey into the depths of The Vortex Vault, this is probably too overwhelming a place to make your first incursion.\nBrainwashed\nAndrew Liles shuts the door on the Vortex Vault with this final installment which includes contributions from Steven Stapleton, R.K. Faulhaber, and Matt Waldron. It's an atypical entry in the series and one of the most intriguing if only be cause of its spectacular finale.\nStapleton is listed as contributing to the first track, \"Ohm,\" but it's unclear exactly what he does. The atmospherics the song delves into toward the end sound more like his style than does the voice that repeats the title as if i n a mantra devoid of mysticism. It's a somewhat disappointing track given the personnel. More amusing is \"As On a Dung Hill,\" in which R.K. Faulhaber lists se lf-deprecating traits such as \"I am filthy/I am riddled with lice/Dogs, when they look at me, vomit/My skin is encrusted with the scabs and scales of leprosy an d covered with yellowish puss.\" Its playful organ and drums make it one of the more accessible pieces from the entire series and one of its most humorous. Matt Waldron's vocals and distorted guitar provide the backbone for \"Kojack Witho ut the Hat,\" but the song is a little too repetitive without much of a payoff, and its novelty wears off after repeated listens.\nWhile those three songs aren't without their charms, the real jewel is the nearly 40-minute \"Kay-Loong-Meu-Tuk,\" which sprawls haphazardly in continuously cross-fading 8- to 34-second increments over 95 tracks, cycling through a variety of musical styles in the process. Parenthetically subtitled \"(The Beginning of the End of the End of the Beginning of the End),\" some sections hint at elements that may have been culled from previous Vault material. Yet it's no retread either. Other than the ending passage lifted from the recurring \"Anhedonia,\" I can't pinpoint any specific tracks that may have been used, only general i mpressions. Either way, this song is wholly its own with high-tension drones, rattling machinery, rushing water, sparkling pianos, and a harrowing choir, among many other elements, that make it such a bizarre cinematic treat.\nAs an ending to the album and the Vortex Vault itself, this track may not be an echoing boom, but the haunting impression it leaves is no less subtle. It has been a fantastic run, and this sweeping epic seals the Vault shut unforgettably.\nWritten by Matthew Amundsen\nMonday, 10 March 2008\nClassical Drone\nThe last volume, Black End, goes even further off the deep end. Liles shows his penchant for black metal (a \"black\" phrase that somehow didn't get used for a title in the series) in the track As On a Dung Hill, a truly morbid poetry reading by R. K. Faulhaber recalling the lyrics of the more obsessed black metal artists. Liles has expressed a love of metal in interviews, and we also get some deranged surf guitar (played by irr. app (ext.)'s Matt Waldron) of Kojack Without The Hat. Most bizarre is the last item on the disc, a thirty-nine minute excursion entitled Kay-Loong-Meu-Tuk (The Begining of the End of the End of the Begining of the End) [sic], which is divided into 95 tracks ranging in length from … well, it's hard to say. For the two shortest tracks, iTunes reports the time as \"not available\" and reports the two longest tracks at more than 15 hours. There's some serious f***ery going on in the CD's table of contents. Also notable is that Black End is the only Vortex Vault CD that is not available at emusic, Amazon, and iTunes. The piece itself is quite lovely, moving through watery field recordings, drones, a minor-key melody looped on the cello that segues into Auld Lang Syne on bagpipes, sampled choirs and orchestras, power tools, all combined in a fitting epic to close the suite.\nWhat comes across through the three Vortex Vault albums that I've heard is a dissatisfaction with any individual genres, but a healthy curiosity and exploration, a refusal to get pinned down in any single area of music. I come away from this set with the highest admiration for Liles, and I look forward to hearing more of his music in the future.",

            "about": "THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX was originally released in 2014 as a 2 track 10″ E.P. using the sound design for the critically acclaimed film ‘Berberian Sound Studio’.\nThis is the first time that THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX has appeared digitally and it has been remastered especially for this format.\nThis expanded version of THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX also features 5 tracks of previously unreleased and unused sound FX and sound treatments.\nBerberian Sound Studio was the second feature film by British director and screenwriter Peter Strickland. The film, starring Toby Jones, is a psychological thriller set in a 1970’s Italian horror film studio.\nBelow is the promo text for the original release by the record label.\nDeath Waltz Recording Company in association with director Peter Strickland and audio historian Andrew Liles are proud to present the world premiere release of a true classic of Italian cinema: the 1977 giallo THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX. A tale of a coven of witches presiding under a riding academy, the film has been hailed by both critics and detractors as one of the most disturbing pictures ever made, with much of the credit going to the film’s soundtrack. Supervised by director Giancarlo Santini and created by sound engineer Gilderoy, THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX is less a score and more a journey into the unconscious, where ghosts swirl with ethereal drones as screams echo into the night. Adding to this is the conspiratorial dialogue from actresses Silvia, Claudia, and Elisa, reading bizarre incantations that unleash the full horror of what lies beneath. We dare you to come out unscathed from the bloodcurdling terror that is THE EQUESTRIAN VORTEX.\n2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "This recording was released in 3 formats -\n1.) 23 TRACK DOWNLOAD\n2.) CDR + 23 TRACK DOWNLOAD - SOLD OUT\nThe CDR contains a 46 minute track (The π Key) which will not be available for download. This item is released in an edition of 25.\n3.) THE π KEY - DELUXE EDITION - SOLD OUT\nWOODEN KEY + ANTIQUE 6\" RECORD HOUSED IN SIGNED AND NUMBERED BESPOKE COVER + CDR + 23 TRACK DOWNLOAD\nEach individual CDR is unique to each order as it contains the 46 minute track (The π Key) plus the two tracks from the 6\" record included in your package. This item is released in an edition of 23.\nTHE GEOMETRY OF SOCIAL DEPRIVATION is constructed from samples and manipulated sounds garnered from twenty-three 6\" shellac records from the 1920's.\nEach track contains a blend of loops and sampled fragments constructed from one record using the sound found on both the A and B sides. Each track is created from a different record. No additional instrumentation has been added.\nThis sometimes soft and ambient but challenging and abstract 8 hour suite of crackling, dusty and forgotten sounds of yesteryear has been designed to be played as a functional piece of music, to while away the hours as you go about your daily routine... a faint drone in the background or a suffocating, all encompassing sonic assault. Equally it can be utilised as an aid to spend your evenings 'researching' a field of your choosing.\n2019 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\nREVIEWS\nVITAL WEEKLY\nOne of the best purchases I made last year was ‘Sleep’, an eight hour suite by Max Richter. Firstly because it did exactly what it said on the tin as I cannot count the times I actually fell asleep listening to it, and secondly because the, for some, absurd length allowed the music to come alive, slowly and unobtrusively penetrating my mind and, indeed, my body.\nThis new release by Andrew Liles, known for this work in Nurse With Wound but perhaps more importantly also the purveyor of an incredible body of solo work, rivals ‘Sleep’. Not only for its length, as ‘The Geometry Of Social Deprivation’ is also around eight hours in duration, but primarily for its beauty and utilitarian purpose.\nThe number 23 is central to this release. Those in Thee Know, will know 23 denotes adventure combined with creativity, freedom, sensuality and an interest in nearly everything. People with 23 in their numerology charts are apparently also good salespersons, which comes in handy when selling your own product.\nAllow me to elaborate on the number 23 in relation to the music on offer. The album consists of 23 tracks, each one constructed taking samples from 23 six inch shellac records from the 1920’s. This strict working method means each track has a unique identity and sound of its own. And, to me personally, Liles’ music works is at its best when his compositions are based on a limited and thematic amount of samples, allowing his compositions to develop a life of their own and giving the music a thematic focus that prevents the music from entering The Abyss of Chaos.\nThe eight hours of music on ‘The Geometry Of Social Deprivation’ buzzes, scrapes, scratches, soothes, pleases and (luckily also) irritates. At times it makes you feel you’re launched into a 1920’s surreal dandy club and the next moment you’re in some sort of decadent 2000’s downtown joint. Intended as a ‘functional’ piece of music, much like Max Richter’s ‘Sleep’ box set, Liles’ new piece de resistance is best enjoyed whilst at work or as a soundtrack to your daily routine. ‘The Geometry Of Social Deprivation’ is, both in concept as in execution, an essential addition to an already quite diverse catalogue of Liles’ work. The album is available in three formats: a 23 track download, a CDR version including the 23 track download as well as an exclusive recording and finally, the ‘deluxe’ edition (a very popular format these days for receding hairline acts from the 1970’s and 1980’s) featuring all of the above as well as a wooden key and one of the original shellac records in a bespoke cover. That the deluxe edition is limited to the number of shellac records used, only 23 copies, makes perfect sense.\n‘The Geometry Of Social Deprivation’ is the ideal and essential soundtrack to long winter days spent in isolation. I have ordered mine, order yours now! (FK)\nWAS IST DAS\nAlways weird, never precious, always interesting.\nRead the full review here -\nwasistdas.co.uk/geoprivation.htm?fbclid=IwAR1SHFNGMFb5iOhpEK3P3naLf7au9nXJP-YOEw2ykBOKD8I9BcEzjibDL9A\nTHE QUIETUS\nOn paper, Andrew Liles’ latest release bears similarities with the similarly prolific output of James Leyland Kirby’s The Caretaker, where both use antique records of popular song as their sound source. But whereas Kirby created ambient washes that provoked notions of memory and nostalgia, Liles’ soundscapes are more insidiously complex, both in concept and execution.\nFirst of all, the parameters are severely strict and numerologically sensitive: armed with 23 shellac singles from the 1920s, Liles set himself the task of transmogrifying the two sides of each platter into its own 23 minute composition with “No additional instrumentation”.\nThere is a fascinating rupture between the title’s suggestion of a postcode lottery, and the sounds within. Initially primed to dwell on the real sociological consequences of exclusion, poverty and disaffectedness, amplified by the cover photo of a lone child (a portrait of the artist as a young man perhaps), our attention is then absorbed by unreal dimensions of the hallucinogenic, ‘hall of mirrors’ of stretching, shifting samples. As mournful, narcotised horns float on seas of surface noise, beatific songs hypnotically loop, and Oramic-like electronic worms writhe, each 23 minute excursion is like a window into another dimension, but too dark and delirious to be escapist fantasy or ambient nostalgia.\nThe accompanying notes prescribe its eight-hour duration to be used “as a functional piece of music… as you go about your daily routine”. But given the quality of the work – like snow, each part of a cohesive body yet uniquely detailed - I would suggest its 23 chapters are taken like a novel and lived with over an extended period of time.",

            "about": "THE MALEFICENT MONSTER & OTHER MACABRE STORIES was released as a ‘Best of’ single L.P. and in an extended form as 'SNUFF BOX', a deluxe 3 CD box set . This download is all the tracks from 'SNUFF BOX'.\nThis collection consists of themes, incidental music, bridging songs, interludes and creaks and groans created as imaginary soundtracks for imaginary horror films. 70 tracks of musical interpretations on a ‘horrific’ theme influenced by such maestros as Donald Rubinstein, John Carpenter, Fabio Frizzi and Ennio Morricone. The tracks cover a vast amount of ground including austere orchestral pieces, voodoo drums, torture porn, possession, cheesy 80’s soundtracks, Giallo, 70’s synths, Mellotrons, flutes, ethereal piano and much much more.\nItalian narration and translation courtesy of Simona Dalla Valle. Japanese narration and translation courtesy of Tomomi Kojo-Robertson. Russian narration and translation courtesy of Ksenia Nefedova. All other voices Melon Liles.\nCover image comes from Graham Humphreys the revered British designer and illustrator responsible for some of the best film posters of the 1980′s including Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street and album covers for The Cramps and The Lords of the New Church.\n2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "A foray into modernist composition adopting influences from the vanguard of 50's and 60's Avant Garde, The Power Elite showcases Liles’ talent at crafting truly original art. The conceptual nature of this release concerns itself with the impotence of the masses living in the shadow of military, economic and political institutions. The Power Elite was Liles’ second release for Steven Stapleton’s United Dairies label.\n”…exquisitely complex, peculiar and pensive themes that commiserate the perversity and sheer villainy of the 21st Century.” – The Quietus\n“A masterpiece of modern contemporary composition. Absolute brilliance!” – Steven Stapleton\n2016 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",
            "credits": "released September 3, 2016\nREVIEWS\nTHE QUIETUS\nThe picture the prolific Andrew Liles paints on The Power Elite is not an uplifting one either, but one whose dread and despair is devilishly dramatic and thoroughly vindicating. Starting off with a collective wailing and then sliding into a disconcertingly warped noir theme, it lumbers warily forward into a hellish landscape applied from a largely orchestral palette.\nThough still deploying the unexpected and twisted musical dioramas that Liles excels at, The Power Elite neither summons a phantasmagoric world, nor mines our subconscious. Instead, it is situated in the very real present day. The elite of the title, though once the subject of conspiracy theories, are the now accepted “military, economic and political institutions” whose insidiously cultivated and seemingly irreversible system protects their status while the rest of society wilfully aspire to touch their hems. Knowledge of this contemporary, legitimate concept, although not essential, makes the soundwork even more chilling.\nDeveloping his unique command of avant-garde composition showcased across the temporal experiments of his four-part Through Time series, here Liles corrupts the doomy toll of church bells alongside stern themes on treated piano and bowed instruments with whirring percussion and nightmare choirs. Their repeated contortions are as if heard on the brink of anaesthesia as Liles peels back his sound sources to expose the signals of a pervasive authority brainwashing its subjects. Together they form exquisitely complex, peculiar and pensive themes that commiserate the perversity and sheer villainy of the 21st Century. (RC)\nLE SON DU ARISLI\nDerrière les visages du couple Blair – à peine déformés – se lève une armée de voix prêtes à lui demander des comptes. Ce n’est pas la première fois qu’Andrew Liles signe une musique « qui fait parler » (on pense d’abord à The Surveillance Lounge, en Nurse With Wound) mais avec The Power Elite, ce sera seulement le temps de l’introduction.\nCar les porteurs de murmures auront vite fait d’aviser d’autres instruments – percussions, cordes souvent grinçantes, grand piano… – qui leur permettront d’entamer une danse macabre, particulière pour être chargée de sens : combien de déceptions politiques (on sait Liles défait par le Brexit récemment plébiscité), combien de fois l’impression de ne pas avoir été écoutés ?\nDes années après, c’est l’heure de la revanche. Remontant les horloges – les détraquant à force, ils provoquent par exemple la rencontre de Tony Blair et d’Horatio Alger, dont LeRoi Jones réinventait jadis la mort –, les facétieux fantômes menacent et leurs plaintes jouent d’échos. En conséquence, leur bal est inquiétant, qui finira sur l’Air de la Reine de la Nuit – hier avec Stapleton, Liles manipulait Beethoven ; c’est aujourd’hui Mozart qu’il interpelle, et, avec son concours, toute l’élite qu’il disc.\nBRAINWASHED\nI cannot pretend to keep up with Andrew Liles’ overwhelmingly voluminous solo output, but I pounced on this album, as it seemed significant that the generally dormant United Dairies label had reawakened to bestow its imprimatur upon this opus. Happily, my instincts proved to be unerring (as usual). United Dairies is the perfect home for an album as aberrant as this one: while Steven Stapleton has described it as “a masterpiece of modern contemporary composition” and Liles ostensibly drew his inspiration from the ’50s and ’60s avant-garde, The Power Elite more accurately sounds like a prolonged nightmare taking place inside the rusted machinery of a clock tower. This is easily one of the year’s strangest and most adventurous albums.\nAlthough its musical inspirations look reverently backwards, the conceptual inspirations behind The Power Elite are grimly contemporary, abstractly conveying “the impotence of the masses living in the shadow of military, economic and political institutions.” Much like a Merzbow album, however, that conceptual inspiration does not manifest itself all that obviously in the actual music (other than making it clear that this album is dark for a reason). Still, it is nice to know that NWW are united in their opinions on the state of the world (Dark Fat was dedicated to “psychopathic scumbag individuals, regimes and corporate filth”). For the most part, The Power Elite just sounds hallucinatory and hellish, though whether it represents the living nightmare of the masses or the imagined Boschian future hell of the damned architects of our current state is anybody’s guess (perhaps both?). There is a smattering of earthbound touches like distant church bells throughout the album, but the warped and pitch-shifted voices of “Artificially Induced Consciousness” definitely lie the otherworldly place between “bovine” and “demonic.” Incidentally, “Artificially Induced Consciousness” is one of the most impressive and fully realized pieces on the album, beautifully weaving a queasily dissonant reverie that sounds like an infernal barnyard full of out-of-tune, fitfully operational music boxes.\nWhile a few of the other pieces are distinguished by the aforementioned voices or bells, the overall aesthetic of The Power Elite seems to be one of overlapping plinking and pointillist strings and discordant strums. It sounds like Liles’ arsenal consisted primarily of music boxes and rusty, out-of-tune harps, but he could have been plucking at the guts of a heavily modified piano as well. In any case, the overall effect is quite a disorienting one of rippling, layered dissonance occasionally embellished by unintelligible voices or distantly chiming bells. The only real classical avant-garde reference point that I can think of is Morton Feldman, as all of the pieces here bleed together to create a sustained and simmering uneasiness. Unexpectedly, however, there are few departures from that aesthetic near the end of the album. The first is “Affluenza,” which seems to employ bowed strings to achieve something almost melodic, though the primary emphasis is still upon texture and harmonic overtones. Much more dramatic is the following “The Iron Law of the Oligarchy,” which collages layers of sampled operatic sopranos with a dissonant piano performance and something that sounds like someone having a laser battle in a pigpen while strangling a balloon animal. It is probably safe to say that I will not use that description for any other albums this year. Near the beginning of the album, “Horatio Alger Myth” is also a bit of curveball, converging into a sickly assemblage of woodwinds and brass for a very wrong-sounding fanfare.\nIf The Power Elite has any real shortcoming, it is merely that only “The Iron Law of Oligarchy” strongly stands out as an individual piece. In the wrong light, it might seem like Liles is endlessly recycling the same ideas for the majority of the album, but it seems like a conscious and sound aesthetic decision from where I am sitting. If the album lacks in distinct peaks, it more than makes up for it with its masterfully sustained mood and seamlessly flowing arc. Also, for a symphony of utter wrongness, The Power Elite is surprisingly listenable, as it never feels particularly jarring or heavy-handed at all. While it is definitely uneasy listening in the extreme, I cannot say that I have ever heard anything else quite like it, which makes it a bit of a minor masterpiece and very likely to be the strongest release to come from the NWW camp this year.\nBOOMKAT\nUtterly riveting modernist composition by NWW’s Andrew Liles, twisting influence from original ‘50s and ‘60s avant garde pioneers into a conceptual suite concerned with “the impotence of the masses living in the shadow of military, economic and political institutions”, and suitably sleeved in pictures of Tony and Cherie Blair before make-up (or after the mob gets ‘em).\nUsing a range of sonic signifiers for power, oppression and gloom such as church bells, blackened minor key baroque themes and deflated, limpid choral discord, each diffused and smeared across the stern field in a toxic miasma, Liles conjures a feeling of deep, pensive unease that strongly resonates with his conceptual intent in The Power Elite.\nIn typical NWW or Liles fashion, the suite proceeds seamlessly thru the gloom with scarcely any handrails to guide the way, and the ones that do appear tend to dissolve with warning, leaving his spectrally diaphanous, morphing projections as the only source of light to cling onto.\nWith discomfiting effect, he queasily emulates a state of submission and helplessness, allowing sounds to wash over the listener in a stilted, curdling flow of disjointed information, perhaps requiring the listener to act as non-passive impedance or resistance in order to properly process his aesthetic as rhetoric.",

            "about": "Originally released as a CD on Beta Lactam Ring Records in 2008.\nREVIEWS\nCyclic Defrost Magazine\n‘When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro…’ - that saying might well apply to this bizarre collaboration between Andrew Liles and Daniel Menche. Anyone up for a dark ambient concept album about the life-cycle of flies? Don’t all rush at once…\nAndrew Liles is an esoteric production maestro based in Brighton, who has worked with the likes of Nurse With Wound and Current 93, and Daniel Menche is an established noise musician from Portland, and this is their first collaboration. Separately, Liles and Menche have released - well, a lot of albums - I gave up counting them actually… But this is no mere soulless foray into the avant-garde. This is 100% genuine, straight-up, satisfaction-guaranteed-or-your-money-back weirdness, with a real artistry to it. The Progeny of Flies plays like the best soundtrack to the best film of the best Murakami novel that hasn’t yet been written.\nYou want sensurround drones? Tick. You want ghostly piano notes? Tick. You want the odd buzzing fly sound? Uh, tick. It’s all here - and then some. This is a great record, bursting with oneiric strangeness and somnambulistic intent. Deserves to sell more copies than Coldplay.\nEwan Burke",

            "about": "This album was originally issued as a LP by Lumberton Trading Company in an edition of 150.\nIt appears here for the first time digitally and is slightly longer than the original vinyl mix.\nThe Inevitable Beatification of Diamond Dave, is dedicated to David Lee Roth.\nDavid Lee Roth is a larger than life character. He is an abstract man. His interviews are fascinating. Diamond Dave is a unique enigma and (to me at least) unwittingly, or perhaps wittingly, an avantgarde performance artist.\nThis recording came to life from a seed, a seed that was inadvertently planted by my friend Matt Sweeney. He sent me a link to a long, rambling and often utterly baffling interview with David Lee Roth.\nI extracted the audio from the interview and converted it into text. I then took David Lee Roth’s words and cut them up randomly. To further confuse matters, I had a text to voice plugin read back the tangle of words using a setting for reading Albanian rather than English.\nThe words no longer made any sense, they were no longer in any decipherable language. But they were, and still are, David Lee Roth, but simultaneously not him at all.\n‘Why?’ you may ask. Basically because I can, and why not? But primarily to make my life difficult by setting myself musical and conceptually perplexing challenges. The result being, as with many of my recordings, a document that only truly makes sense to me.\nRegardless of its convoluted pretensions, this recording is an abstract, disorientated and confused homage to Diamond Dave, and, as we all know, diamonds are forever.\nMany thanks to Ben ‘Hot for Teacher’ Chasny, Giulio ‘The Things I do for You’ Di Mauro, Vivian Slaughter and Matt ‘Drop Dead Legs’ Sweeney.\nThis recording is in no way connected to, approved by or related to David Lee Roth or associated companies.",

            "about": "'Torch Songs' originally appeared as a double LP on Die Stadt in 2007.\nThis version of 'Torch Songs' is remastered and available for the very first time in a digital format.\nColeclough and Liles met in October 2004 when they both performed at Intergration 3 in Preston, UK. Liles subsequently reworked the recording of Coleclough's solo performance from that evening. He went on to add, subtract, multiply and divide further live recordings supplied by Coleclough, and the eventual result was this recording.\nMany thanks to Geoff Sawers who provided the amazing artwork for the original L.P. and who played 'brush' on tracks 3 and 4.\nREVIEWS FOR 'BURN' and 'TORCH SONGS'\nVITAL WEEKLY\nSilence, please: drone meisters at work. Not the most unknown, or maybe even the superstars of the lot. Jonathan Coleclough has built a fine oeuvre of work, in which the collaborations with others plays an important role. Andrew Liles is these days a member of Nurse With Wound and travels around now that the Nurses are a live act. Still he finds time to create many, many solo works, such as a twelve CD series for Beta Lactam-ring. And to work with Jonathan Coleclough. The cover suggests that the works were recorded in concert, but perhaps not. Liles' characteristic synthesizer and reverb are present, and Coleclough brings in the use of contact microphones, field recordings and computer manipulation. Careful drone material, that doesn't just swell on a bunch of deep end bass drones (listening to the sea again, as a friend of mine once called this), but there is more happening than just that. Water sounds, clay pots and such like are being used, which especially on side D gives a surprising piece. It was perhaps only last week when I wrote: \"drone, where to now?\" and perhaps as such this is not the way out, but it's surely a great work. And like with so many of Die Stadt releases, the first few copies come with a CD, here a solo one by Coleclough. It starts out not unlike the collaboration with a few isolated sounds, which feed of eventually through some sounds effects or computer programming. A bit more austere and less dense than the 2LP set, but certainly a great concert. Clocking at twenty-six minutes, this also has the perfect length for a good concert.\nTOKAFI\nArtists usually placed in the “Torch Song” tradition include Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Edith Piaf and – if you’re looking for some slighly more contemporary examples - Morrissey and Elvis Costello. This must be the first time, then, that two artist from the drone sector have decided to add their compositions about unrequited love and the desire to possess what can never be one’s own to the long list of standards. What seems like a contradiction in terms at the outset has turned into an almost sacral collection of – well not songs, but something of the sort anyway.\nWhile some not too obvious collaborations yield interesting results despite their inner tensions, this one works because the styles of Jonathan Coleclough and Andrew Liles, regardless of how different and idiosyncratic in their own right they may be, virtually screamed for a symbiosis. On the one hand you have Coleclough, who has only last year celebrated his tenth aniversary as a recording artist with a total of 15 releases and created a niche of his own with a music which originates in the quotidian and subliminates into something alltogether out of the ordinary: The bonus disc to this double LP of two heavy 180g Vinyl records sees him in live action at the “Intergration 3” festival, a concert which incidentally also forms the backbone to some of the tracks to be found here, and documents how he starts with the sounds of various outwardly unspectacular objects and slowly changes their timbre and functionality in a process which takes them into a mysterious yet never depressive space. Liles, on the other hand, has been one of those artists who have allowed multiple influences to penetrate the texture of his highly atmospheric pieces, making him almost unpredictable and lending his work an air of excitment. For “Torch Songs”, he concentrates on the deep sonorities, the physical frequencies and the parts of the spectrum where everything becomes opaque, blurry and intellectually intangible. His drones are either subliminally massive or so evanescent as to appear almost weightless and disturbingly fog-like: They will give way if you walk through them, but there are dangers lurking with each step. Coleclough’s very direct object treatments contrast with these meditative fields in a hypnotic fashion, focussing the listener’s attention while the impending pulsations do their job in feverishly massaging the unconscious. The element of water appears again and again as a sort of guideline, seperating segments of almost absolute vacuum from each other and mellowing the atmosphere, when the intensity reaches its climax. But at the end it is only incomprehendible whispers that remain, rowing the boat across the Styx into the night.\nThere are no lyrics on any of these songs and even the poem by Geoff Sawers printed on the front, back and inner sleeve of this luxurious gateway cover offers no direct link to the aforementioned tradition. So what makes these pieces qualify as love songs nevertheless? By their very obsession with the unattainable, with places one can not inhabit and material things one can not touch, they, too, are filled with an insatiable longing, which knows no hope for fulfillment. It is dark, it is cold and no one is going to carry that torch for you. That is what this record is about and that is something Billy Holiday could have related to in her most desperate hours. By Tobias Fischer\nPARIS TRANSATLANTIC\nThe highly anticipated pairing of Coleclough and Liles, two among the most bright-minded dispensers of unusual sounds from England, had already caused my mental bells to ring out joyously in advance. Geoff Sawers' poem \"I dreamt I was a river\" is painted on the white cover of a double LP that, in its special 250-copy limited edition, also contains a CD EP featuring about 25 minutes of Coleclough's original set at Preston's Intergration 3, where the two protagonists first met in 2004. Liles (a prolific musician if ever there was one, with an average of an album per month these days, not including his collaborations with the likes of Nurse With Wound and Darren Tate) took the recording of Coleclough's performance home and proceeded to \"add, subtract, multiply and divide\" additional source sounds provided by his latest collaborator. Each of the eight soundscapes on Torch Songs finds the perfect spot for every sound to exist and be accepted in that grey area where uneven energies try to work our knowledge into forgetting conventional codes and meanings. Elements of pulse are not totally absent in the manipulation of sound objects, location recordings and drones, each \"torch song\" analyzing them exhaustively, combining manifestations of real activity (including the wonderful voices of Nature) with a cathartic, profane consciousness of something that no religion or philosophy will ever be able to explain. The overall sense is one of solitary awareness, and it feels great. Torch Songs is a minor classic, and I look forward to a swift CD reissue (it often happens with Die Stadt) to save us from having to get up and change sides, and dispense with occasional distortions that appear during the most charged surges.–MR\nTHE WIRE\nBased on live and studio pieces produced by drone alchemist Coleclough, Torch Songs features long stretches of music that are as exquisitely tactile as you would expect, but with subtly roughed up snags and edges that one presumes result from the input of current Nurse With Wound member Liles.\nHer [!] micro-gestures serve to ground Coleclough's gauzy textures and save the whole thing from becoming just too perfect. The springy beats that materialise on side four have that same delightful incongruity that Liles's Nurse With Wound boss Steven Stapleton is such a master of, albeit it with a tad less slapstick involved. By Keith Moline\nAQUARIUS RECORDS\nMuch like the entire back catalogue of John Duncan, British avant-drone artist Jonathan Coleclough has often buttressed his work through an ongoing set of collaborations, each of which push his work into interesting territories while maintaining that essence of Coleclough that makes all of his albums so enthralling. His 2006 collaboration with Murmer was easily one of the best drone albums of that year, twisting field recordings and quiet sessions with electric objects into a gauzy, crepuscular blur that even made those at Artforum perk up their ears and listen.\nTorch Songs came to fruition when both Coleclough and Liles performed in Preston (probably at the request of the ever-charming Colin Potter) in 2005. In fact, much of the source material for Torch Songs originated from Coleclough’s performance to which Liles went on to ‘add, subtract, multiply, and divide’ further.\nThe fundamentals of Torch Songs are primarily Coleclough’s signature moves: swelling, resonant drones manipulated from acoustic sources and distilled into tonally vibrant beams of pure sound. Yet, Liles (who in and of himself is a fine technician of sonic alchemy to the point where he has often graced the stage alongside Steve Stapleton, Colin Potter, and Matt Waldron in Nurse With Wound) interjects his own sidereal gestures with wooden creaks, digital time stretching, radiant eruptions of dissonant couplings with Coleclough’s drones, and occasional jaunts of heavily filtered tin-can and rubber-band rhythms that parallel much of the output from Liles’ recent 12 part Vortex series. Yet for all of Liles’ baroque flares for the sonically surreal, it is Coleclough who authors the strongest material on Torch Songs through his sublime use of the drone. Jim Haynes, Aquarius Records, March 2007.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Lucas Schleicher\nSunday, 27 May 2007\nThere may not be a more satisfying album than this released all year. Wound tight around the spine of a clear idea is a simple and elegant network of art, music, and performance cemented in wonder. Torch Songs is firm and tangible: a mass of skin, muscle, and bone that strikes and, in striking, cuts a path from earth to the stars.\nJonathan Coleclough, Andrew Liles, and artists Geoff Sawers and Iwanaga Keiko have done more than offer up an album for consumption. It is impossible to pick up this release from Die Stadt and ignore the work binding the songs together: a full-color, painted poem (its contents spanning three languages) dresses this beautiful gatefold sleeve.\n\"One night I find / myself wandering / through a dark and tangled wood / The air is damp / the trees are dripping / hung with mosses and / ferns...\" Abstract music exhibits a tendency to reach for the stars too quickly, to remove itself from the confines of the body and the mud and lilt ever upwards towards the vast, black, and less exacting firmament. For those of us still riddled by gravity and the laws of the sciences, such music is a kind of escapism: whether haunting or illuminating, such music is the space where tired heads can go to rejuvenate. Over time this sort of idealism has rendered a laziness. Many artists and aspiring musicians forget why the space exists and its beauty is slowly effaced in the name of interesting sounds and a vulgar modernism that abhors any romance and every principled conviction. Coleclough and Liles, however, know better: Torch Songs is given a context and framed within a night of strange wandering. As the poem continues, stars become visible through the thick network of branches over our nameless narrator's head, but they are as of yet unrecognizable. Coleclough and Liles begin with their feet on the ground and their music opens from within the earth as it were: it is a weird conglomeration of foggy hums and metallic clattering stretching out as a flower bed. From it a further development will emerge: the stars and that space of comfort are visible, but we cannot begin there or make our journey there easily, and our artists know it.\nI won't spoil the rest of the package but this release functions as a whole and it is useless talking about the music without mentioning what it is housed in. The gatefold packaging isn't merely artwork, it's art conceptualized within the performance that is this project's genesis. Torch Songs began in 2004 when Liles remixed Coleclough's live performance at the Intergration 3 festival in the UK. Subsequent recordings were sent to Liles and yielded eight distinct, but unified songs made from spectral moans, glass bowls, metallic knick-knacks, wooden toys, marbles, bows, perverted bagpipes, and perhaps many other instruments of various shapes and sizes. In 2005 Geoff Sawers painted what would become the cover to Torch Songs during one of Coleclough's performances. Sawers painting not only binds this project together, it is featured as part of the music on the record: his brush strokes can be heard on side B. Torch Songs is carefully considered, a well-developed collaboration that pulls out all of the stops and convenes on a meaning or on a concrete thought and moves from there. Further art artifacts are included as images on either side of the LP sleeves and they all seem to refer to one another, each one fleshing out the strange narrative that begins in the poem.\nThe music itself is not entirely characteristic of either performer, though what I love most about both Coleclough and Liles is evident throughout. On a basic level the music runs a gamut of moods, acknowledging fear, uncertainty, meditative calm, and a lingering playfulness throughout each of the eight tracks. Despite keeping the entire project sensible and understandable from beginning to end, Liles' work on Coleclough's source material is diverse. Each side suggests the next naturally, but each side also surprises and gives birth to new elements. These elements aren't arbitrary, either: as aforementioned there's a tendency in abstract music to move too far outside the realms of the human and to create in a way that ignores the importance of structure, melody, and narrative. Liles' reconstruction may be abstract, but it has identifiable parts and works as a guide, using sound to travel from one place to the next in a natural progression. This puts each of the eight songs right at my finger tips and gives my brain some room to interact with them. I had the good luck to engage this album with good company on a dark night with the windows closed and candles lit. The music shaped the room and made the candles glow brighter, the darkness outside closed into a denser mask, and the individual I was with began to fill the room with me, as though we were the only two people left in the world. It was a singular moment when the music merged with the space and the time I occupied: that memory has been fixed in my mind ever since and will stay there indefinitely.\nTorch Songs will not likely be surpassed by any other release this year: I say this without hesitation. It is unapologetically a sumptuous work of art that goes well beyond being just another record or project between two outstanding musicians. That alone would've been enough: had this come housed in nothing more than a simple sleeve with minimal artwork, I would still be impressed by it and it would still be played quite often. But Torch Songs should be taken as an example of what a little extra time and thought can do for a record; all of the \"extras\" (the artwork, the weight of the vinyl, the presentation of the music, everything in short) renders this release far more substantial and enjoyable. I've heard individuals complain that abstract music is all form and little content, the sputtering catharsis of an air conditioner gone awry: Liles and Coleclough prove it doesn't have to be so. This album has set the bar unbelievably high for me and it's unlikely that I will look at any abstract music the same way now that I've heard it.\nBRAINWASHED\nWritten by Lucas Schleicher\nSunday, 17 January 2010\nBurn is superior in every way to Coleclough's other collaboration from 2008. Andrew Liles' sometimes campy, often spooky penchant for drafting other-worldly drones pairs perfectly with Jonathan's texture-rich audio and their flirtation with musique concrète is both entrancing and fun. With some of the samples apparently being drawn from Coleclough and Liles' 2008 Brainwaves set, Burn has the added bonus of featuring sounds from one of the most entertaining experimental shows I have ever seen.\nColeclough's performance at Brainwaves 2008 sticks out in my mind more than almost any other show from that year. In fact, his use of the now infamous \"torch pen\" is one of the most ingenious and entertaining things I've ever seen from any performer, avant-garde or otherwise. The apparatus was simple: a couple of contact mics were affixed to a plate of glass, which was suspended from a coat hanger. With Liles controlling sound and generating waves of drone, Coleclough proceeded to take a small blow-torch pen to the glass, creating cracks that were then picked up by the mics and transformed into crystalline shards of noise. It was a transfixing and beautiful thing to see and hear, and it made musique concrète more immediate and fun for me than it had ever been before. Whether or not someone was there to witness that show might affect how much they enjoy certain parts of Burn, but this album stands on its own for many other reasons. Jonathan's clever use of fire, glass, and microphones only shows up on one song (\"Blackburn\") and it sounds excellent even without the opportunity to watch it happen live. And Liles' input shouldn't go ignored. His signature is pretty obvious through the record, whether he's editing or inserting some ghostly audio into the mix. If it weren't for his subtle hand, Burn would be a flatter and far less engaging disc.\nThe album gets off to a slow start, though, with \"Sunburn\" dragging a little bit before \"Blackburn\" kicks the record into high gear. Like Bad Light, Burn features a good deal of unprocessed audio. But, it is done to much better effect this time around, in part because Liles provides an anchor for Coleclough's wandering. Bells, chimes, pianos, strings, guitar, prepared piano, and other sundry instruments all show up on various songs, but this time they're integrated into the flow of sound more completely. In fact, \"Heartburn\" features a brief, but powerful guitar interlude that melts perfectly into the surrounding boil of clunking metal and detuned violins. This success probably has a lot to do with Liles' penchant for combining and arranging odd sounds: he finds absolutely no difficulty in blending toys, electronic gizmos, seriously demented noise, and a good bit of humor into his music. Coleclough's expanded musical palette obviously benefits from this ability. It keeps the record from being too haphazard and it lends a lot of diversity to a kind of music that can become stale and uninteresting pretty easily. The length of each track on Burn contributes to its enjoy-ability, too: only two songs exceed the 12-minute mark, and only one ventures off into 20-minute territory. By keeping things brief in some places, Coleclough and Liles make Burn sharper and harder-hitting, which means a lot for a record that features three and four-minute fade-ins, lots of slowly developing themes, and other sonic minutiae.\nFans looking for a document of the Coleclough and Liles Braiwaves performance will be happy to have Burn, but the album offers up a lot more than memories of their live collaboration. Every song is like an extention of that performance, each of which borrows from and expands upon the original conceit. With the added benefit of some studio trickery and a little refinement, their combined effort sounds even better.",

            "about": "Many of my tracks start off as VERY long compositions which are then edited, remixed and adapted into more palatable bite-sized pieces.\nVulcano di Maiale is one such song, it can be found here in its unabridged and unedited original form.\nVarious edited versions of Vulcano di Maiale will appear on 'The 1st 100 Years of Digital Feudalism', a project that will be released as a series of 9 box sets between 2026 and 2028.\nThis is the sister album to 27,000 Slug Teeth which can be found here -  andrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/27000-slug-teeth\nREVIEWS\nDOOM CHARTS\nFasten your interplanetary seatbelts and get ready for an expansive sonic trip brought to you by ANDREW LILES (sometime member of Current 93). This release contains only one song that runs for about 38 minutes and starts with some hypnotic soundscapes that slowly incorporate a repetitive keyboard melody before blasting out a steady beat that gets joined by an incredibly groovy krautrock-inspired bass line with a matching atmosphere just before the 15 minute mark. The rest of the way things shift back and forth between these elements with the emphasis changing multiple times, while on occasion also making room for some spoken samples. It’s a challenging, but utterly fulfilling listening experience once you decide to just turn the lights off and go with the flow. Ronny Dijksterhuis",

            "about": "This recording was originally released in 2014 on L.P.\nWanton Wives is an array of faux Giallo soundtracks and music created for imaginary horror films, influenced by such maestros as Donald Rubinstein, John Carpenter, Fabio Frizzi and Ennio Morricone. The tracks cover a vast amount of ground including austere orchestral pieces, voodoo drums, torture porn, possession, cheesy 80′s soundtracks, Giallo, 70′s synths and Mellotrons.\nThe last track is a horror story written by Liles which was translated and narrated in French by Isabelle Magnon. Saxophone comes from Quentin Rollet.\nAs with ‘THE MALEFICENT MONSTER & OTHER MACABRE STORIES’ the artwork comes from Graham Humphreys the revered British designer and illustrator responsible for some of the best film posters of the 1980′s including Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street and album covers for The Cramps and The Lords of the New Church.\n2014 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

                    "lyrics": "THE NUMB SENSATION The numb sensation? It started last Wednesday, I think. Maybe it was the week before, maybe… in fact it was last month, or was it last year? Possibly it was the year before. The thing is, I just can’t remember anymore, time has lost its meaning. There is no time. No tick, no tock. It started in the tips of my fingers, I just couldn’t feel anything. Nothing at all. It began as a prickling sensation which then turned into a dull and cold feeling. Then nothing. I put them in ice cold water but that had no reaction. I put them in the fire, nothing. I even began to cut them off, nothing. Not even a vague burning feeling, not even so much as a tickle. I assaulted my thumb with a hammer, hitting away until the bone was as flat as a butter knife, but still NOTHING. No sensation whatsoever. Shortly after, maybe a week later, or a month, maybe it was even a year, it could have even been two years. I just have no idea of time anymore. The rest of my body began to go the same way as my fingers. First my toes, no feeling at all, then the whole of one leg and one arm, then the other arm and the other leg. My lips, my ears, my torso, my mouth, my breasts, and lastly, my vagina. Numb, numb, numb. All sense of touch and feeling vanished. I rubbed my body with a wire brush and sandpaper, I still felt nothing. I pulled teeth from my mouth without any suffering. I even smashed my skull against the floor without even the slightest twinge of pain. Intimate tingles of joy, the warmth of the radiating sun on my back, and ice melting in-between my fingers would no longer be simple pleasures. No feelings, no sense, no pain, no ecstasy, nothing, nothing, nothing. But where was that voice coming from? I couldn’t quite hear it properly. What was it saying? It was a muted voice, sounding as if it were underwater, or like someone talking with their mouth full of mashed potatoes. It kept on saying the same thing. Something I could not decipher or understand, yet in some strange way it sounded familiar. Curiously, at around this time, the drizzle started. The days were lit with a strange haze, almost like dusk or dawn, but not quite. A bright grey, an eternal foggy day of a miserable hue. It rained and rained, fine mists of rain. The mists of rain swept around me, yet I could not feel them. I had no sensations, no sense of touch, no feeling. The haze was thick and went on and on, there was no end to it. The strange thing was that night never seemed to fall and day never seemed to break. It was a perpetual twilight. No beginning, no end. It was claustrophobic and mildly irritating and continued relentlessly. Through the mists I could only see a few metres in front of me, and no matter how far I ventured, I always found myself back where I started. Another phenomenon was occasionally there would be a momentary blast of bright light in my eyes, then instantly the drizzle would swamp everything again. The voice continued to babble in its dull, repetitive way. A murmur from deep underground. No definition, no clarity. It seemed to emanate from the back of the inside of my head. Saying the same thing over and over. I had no idea if it was saying something reassuring or menacing. Now accompanying the voice I could hear a very faint melody, something I vaguely remembered from my distant past but could not recall exactly where from. What was it? Was I going insane? What did it all mean? Did it mean anything at all? The voice in my head, the voice with no concise message, the voice with no fidelity, continued, on and on and on. Though now more insistent. More desperate. I could not unravel its meaning or purpose. I could tell from it’s muffled intonation and tempo that the message was now more urgent. The melody also continued to play, circling around and around in my brain, swirling in the far distance. But what could it be? Then it dawned on me after some time, maybe a week later, or a month, or a year, where was everyone? I hadn’t seen anyone for weeks, possibly months or years. It was very strange, why had I not seen anyone? The telephone didn’t ring, there were no letters delivered, no people in the world at all. Where had they all gone? Not only were there no people, but the world no longer seemed to make a sound. The traffic had vanished, the birds no longer sung, there were no aircraft above my head, none of the clattering of everyday life, or buzz of electronics, or idiosyncratic sounds of nature, no sounds at all. I wasn’t deaf, I was aware that I could still hear, I heard my breath, it was a slow, laboured breath. I was so tired, yet could not and did not sleep. My deep breaths continued, yet the world outside had faded away. What was happening to me? Could I be dead? We all know there is no God or heaven or afterlife or reincarnation. Death is where everything fades to black forever. In theory I was still conscious. But then it happened. For some reason I must have fallen asleep after all those days, possibly weeks, maybe even years. I was falling into a dream. A whirling psychedelic vortex, winding through colourful tunnels and expansive oceans, flying high over mountains and into deep blue skies. The world began to become colourful and vibrant once more. Everything was going to be normal again, I could just feel it. A sweet smell of spring and freshly mown grass gave me a sense of well-being. The rattling sounds of life re-emerged and the mists dissipated. I awoke, crashing into reality. My toes began to tingle, then defrost back to normality, my hands could feel the crisp sheets wrapped around me. I could feel the warmth of fresh linen and hear an abundance of machines and people going about their business. The smell of fruit and flowers filled my nose with perfumed joy. An overwhelming sense of calm and relief filled my heart. The once dull voice was now crystal clear to my ears. I knew who it was, he held my hand, and spoke in soft tones of care and affection. I knew exactly what had a happened, it all made sense to me now. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, a new and unknown voice in a firm and emotionless timbre said “There is no hope, It’s over”. A rush of panic violently shook me. They had made a mistake. “No wait, I’m still here” I screamed. There was a click, everything faded to black. Forever.",

            "about": "This recording was originally released as a CD single in May 2010.\nThis cover version of the Current 93 song of the same title was dedicated to David Tibet and released to celebrate 25 years of Current 93.\n'AfterTheOuterLeastDarkness' is a previously unreleased version of 'Where the Long Shadows Fall' and is exclusive to this download.\nCalligraphy: Geoff Cox\nVoices: Daniela Cascella, Melon Liles.\nREVIEWS\nBRAINWASHED\nSunday, 13 June 2010 00:00 John Kealy\nDedicated to David Tibet and made in celebration of Current 93’s 25th anniversary, this single captures the spectral heart of one of Current 93’s defining pieces. Here Andrew Liles reconstructs what was originally the opening volley of Tibet’s Inmost Light trilogy. “Where the Long Shadows Fall” was one of the key moments in Current 93’s career. The combination of Tibet’s lyrics, some achingly gorgeous music and, most significantly, that haunting loop of the last castrato, Alessandro Moreschi, made for one of the finest 20 minutes of music committed to tape. Only a madman would try and outdo the original but Liles proves he is more than capable on this single.\nLiles retains the same mood on his version of the piece; what sounds like another loop of Moreschi’s unnatural singing is allowed to build hypnotically into a misty, unsettling reverie. The ghostly vocals of Daniela Cascella and Melon Liles add another dimension to the piece; their whispers and utterances cutting through like telepathic communications from the other side. What sounds like the sounds of trains are accompanied by deep bass drones before that sad, familiar loop of Moreschi’s singing peaks through like a spectre behind a curtain.\nThis version of “Where the Long Shadows Fall” is frustratingly short at just under 10 minutes but it is perfect in its execution, rivalling the original for its weirdly entrancing beauty. Like Liles’ recent remixes of Current 93’s older releases, this is a fabulous re-imagining of Tibet’s vision.",

            "about": "Without Wisdom features 8 new songs based on those anxious moments of anticipation in the dreaded dental waiting room.\nIn the 1970s when I visited the dentist, the music they played in the waiting room was slow melancholy jazz, jazz featuring the vibraphone. I alluded to this on my recording 'Bad Vibes Waiting Room', which appeared on the 2007 album Black Hole.\nTeeth. Teeth are not really fit for purpose are they? All my neuroses and fears manifest in my mouth. You have to work at keeping your teeth, it's an eternal battle. Natural teeth are disjointed, irregular shapes and never brilliant white. They are not neat and shiny and all in a row like a Hollywood grin, unless you are lucky of course. There is no beauty in them, they are ugly, they fail, they rot, they don't grow back and at some point they will cause unmitigated misery for practically everyone.\nI have always had weird teeth. My incisors are Draculaesque. I was ridiculed at school for having them. In later life I have been asked several times where I have had them 'done', people assuming I have willingly had them cosmetically altered. I always reply that it's a congenital deformity. What makes them even more pronounced is the fact that the neighbouring two teeth are, bizarrely, still milk teeth.\nI've had some terrible experiences at the dentist. I have been in waiting rooms with people running out screaming. Once, the dentist came into the waiting room covered in blood, moaning about patients only coming to him when they were in pain. I have had unnecessary extractions and unnecessary fillings.\nI was very much a victim of the 'heavy metal' generation. For those who don't know, in the 1970s, the NHS in the UK encouraged dentists to 'restore' teeth, which led to many children receiving extensive and often pointless dental work. The 'drill and fill' abuse of the 70s meant that dentists were driven by financial gain rather than the patients' wellbeing. This resulted in the 'heavy metal' generation, creating victims of the predictable and ugly consequences of when money and healthcare coalesce.\nTeeth. Teeth are not really fit for purpose are they?\nJANUARY 2025: DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

            "about": "ZENERPHOBIA is released in the following formats:\ni. DOWNLOAD.\nii. DOWNLOAD + CDR. EDITION OF 35 COPIES: SOLD OUT.\nThe professionally pressed CDR is signed and numbered and comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve.\niii. DOWNLOAD + CDR + HARDBACK BOOK + 3 UNIQUE PHOTOS. EDITION OF 25 COPIES: SOLD OUT.\nThe professionally pressed CDR is signed and numbered and comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve. This art edition includes a 51 page photobook. No book is the same as each one contains 3 unique original photos. The book catalogues the history of the ‘Zoso Research Foundation’ in pictures.\nZenerphobia is a concept album and is based loosely on the idea of an imaginary horror/sci-fi film.\nThe concept is centred around an international team of scientists researching ESP and telekinesis. Their experiments are conducted on children who have the ‘gift’.\nIn short, it’s a half realised movie, a film I would like to see, maybe an overlooked classic from the early 80’s or the late 70’s. It only exists in my head but has managed to find life in this imaginary soundtrack.\nI’ve not considered a cohesive storyline, but only the visual and aural aesthetics. Sterile tiled rooms in a medical environment, Cold War laboratories hidden in secret locations, diodes and strange machines with wires attached to the heads of the paranormally gifted children, children who can telepathically speak to their international counterparts.\nDue to the continual tests using Zener cards, they have become Zenerphobic and plan to revolt. The children will mete vengeance on the cruel scientists who have made their lives miserable.\nThe dialogue for my imaginary movie appears in various languages interspersed throughout the recording. The voices are meant to represent the international scientists studying the children. They are relaying their observations and results via a secret radio channel and on cassette tape.\nIn between the dialogue are various 80’s orientated ‘Dream Pop’ and ‘Ethereal Wave’ guitar based songs.\nSEPTEMBER 2024 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",
