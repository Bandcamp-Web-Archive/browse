            "about": "HC was intended to be my main focus, as I enjoyed more its musicality than the noise of BBLL. Since I could only acheive this by multi-track recording, imagining this music in a concert type of situation was impossible for me at the time so I would only perform as BBLL, which was improvised drone/noise using whatever type of set up I could handle live (ie guitar, mic, tapes and fx). Eventually the ideas and moods of HC blended with BBLL and it became pointless to have two different names for the same 'message'. I dropped all of my monikers and kept BBLL.\nIt was actually through HC music that some interest emerged in the belgian scene for what I was making as a teenager, back in the myspace days. A couple of underground labels asked me to make releases for them, namely Gipsy Sphinx (which released the first BBLL LP) and Funeral Folk, which wanted a full HC album.\nIt took me so long to finish some material which I thought was decent that the idea of a full album became a split LP and then eventually rejected altogether, mainly because of its shitty digital sound.\nI was very influenced by the freeform psychedelic scenes from finland and the USA at the time, especially by Avarus, Kemialliset Ystavat, Six Organs of Admittance, No Neck Blues Band, Davenport and Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice. I was also heavily into the world of Acid Mothers Temple and Rallizés Dénudés. You can definitely hear my poor attempts of copying these great artists in the collection presented here.",

            "about": "Second and final chapter of the EXTANOC saga. As the memories of PCB skinned drums and encoded voices shatter and dissipate, new life forms emerge deep from the squelches of the Void. Antannae, mandibles, wings, claws, teeth and tusks ravage their way through the incandescent flickering flowers of veiled retinas. Eggs hatch where cognition once ruled and the festering ecstasy of larvae awaits a new metamorphosis in the stars.\nRecorded in 2019 at la Drogencasa on 4-track cassette.\nReleased by Lonktaar in an edition of 44 copies.

            "about": "Floot was a very short-lived moniker that i had when i met Alvaro Partidas aka Die Ursache one summer in Venezuela. We had gotten in touch through myspace because i saw he was one of the few people making harsh noise in Caracas and that shared it online. I showed him all the stuff i was recording at the time and he decided to release a 3-way split of my projects:\nHatanaka Creatures: psychedelic rock/folk in the vein of the freakfolk scene at the time.\nRipples: short songs on acoustic guitar and some effects/ambiances (a sort of cheap rip off of Six Organs of Admittance)\nBear Bones, Lay Low: free noise with a psychedelic touch.\nEventually all the other projects except BBLL got trashed because i didn't see the point in having so many names and just blended everything under one moniker. Weirdly, it was the name i liked the least of the three...\nThis was released in Caracas, Venezuela during the summer of 2006 on Die Ursache's now-defunct Hormigon label in a small edition of around 20 copies with hand painted covers, inlays and cd-r's.",

            "about": "The material on this record was made between March and July 2020 and as it is often my case, without a particular aim or a predefined concept beforehand. It was a time i was beginning to grow tired of dance-orientated music, a path i was eager to explore for a good five or so years before, and i was starting to feel a bit limited. So everyday i would just record a bunch of improvisations and test out configurations that would allow me to create things on the spot, without having to resort to multi-track methods. The stuff that came out was hence more calm and free, much like the state of mind i wanted (and still want to) develop. While piecing it together like a collage, it felt like this album would be about the birth and life of ideas, about the way we can follow our mind and intuition without preconceived plans and how these completely unknown forms create something with meaning and eventually lead a life of its own. I'm glad that it didn't come out on cassette as it was initially planned back then in 2020, as i revisited the original version and modified certain aspects to accentuate the vibe of serenity i was looking for. For once, i don't wish to impress or impose myself: this record is something i hope can accompany you in the background, as something that creates an atmosphere for you to reflect and come up with ideas that can help you and others.\nReleased by Kraak and Nonlocal Research, november 2023\nkraak.bandcamp.com/album/ideas-flotantes\nnonlocalresearch.bandcamp.com/album/ideas-flotantes",

            "about": "Polonius and i embarked on a 2-week tour at a time things were opening up and relaxing (a bit) back 2021. One of the most memorable nights for me was on the 19/10/21 in Bologna when this was recorded. Not because there was a lot of people or amazing energy or things like that... almost the opposite actually! i just felt very in tune and loose with the music, being guided by instinct and will rather than rationality. Polo also played a great set which i felt was his transition from mythomagical polo of the beginning to full blown free juke freakout polo of today.\nThanks to the kind fratelli of Random Numbers for releasing this.
