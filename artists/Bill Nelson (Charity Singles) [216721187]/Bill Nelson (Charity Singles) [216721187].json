            "about": "\"A Million Whistling Milkmen\" is a song Bill Nelson originally composed and recorded exclusively for the Sara's Hope Foundation. The charity's aim was \"to provide holiday breaks for children living with cancer, giving them smiles, hope, and precious memories.\"\nThe track was premiered at Nelsonica 08 on 1 November 2008, with a special playback of the finished recording in advance of its eventual release on Bill's 60th birthday.\nFans can download the song in return for a modest donation to 'Sara's Dream Foundation.'\n\"It's about the 'milk of human kindness', using the metaphor of other-worldly milkmen as 'angels' delivering kindness and compassion to the world, fresh each day. It seems ideally suited to Sara's Hope Foundation's goal.\"- Bill Nelson (2008)",

            "about": "\"Six Strings for Sara\" is an instrumental track that was the first exclusive musical offering to be made available through Sara's Hope Foundation, a charity for which Bill Nelson was a patron. The Charity was set up in the memory of Sara Hoburn, who tragically lost her battle with colon cancer in 2001 at the age of 16. Inspired by Sara's strength, warmth and positivity, her family and close friends raised the funds to build and run a holiday retreat in the sun for children facing similar battles and emotions.\nAfter meeting Sara's dad at a fan convention, and hearing how brave Sara battled the disease, the guitarist was so moved that he decided to compose and record the instrumental. All proceeds from the download have been kindly donated by Bill to the foundation. Fans can download the song in return for a modest donation to 'Sara's Dream Foundation.'\n\"You'll never be able to hear this piece of music anywhere else, and it's a corker...\nAnd don't forget, by choosing to listen to it, you'll be bringing a little sunshine into the lives of people who will really appreciate, and benefit by your generous support. So, show your good, kind hearts, citizens of Dreamsville and go for it!\" - Bill Nelson (2007)",
