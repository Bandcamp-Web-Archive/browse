            "about": "This is the first ever released recording of this unique trio comprising of:\nBill Nelson (Be Bop Deluxe/Red Noise)\nTheo Travis (Soft Machine/Robert Fripp/Steven Wilson)\nDave Sturt (Gong/Jade Warrior).\nThe trio performed various concerts between 2009 and 2019 often as part of Bill Nelson’s ‘Nelsonica’ conventions. Following years of planning and preparation, this album consists of live recordings made by the trio in 2011, 2012 and 2018 from 3 concerts in Leeds and York.\nThe music, a broad sound palette from ambient soundscapes, to rocky workouts and ethereal mood painting was improvised over loosely prepared structures. with occasional use of backing tracks produced by Bill Nelson.\nThe performances demonstrate a clarity of vision and empathy between the players with Nelson’s distinctive guitar tone prevalent throughout, supported by Sturt’s fretless bass and atmospheric Ebow work and Travis’ soaring saxophone and flute lines, also utilising live looping techniques.",
