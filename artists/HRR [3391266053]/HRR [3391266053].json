            "about": "Everything good must come to an end. The worst thing about being a fan of nightcore or any genre of music is that when you die, you can no longer listen to it. Not many religions mention nightcore in their holy texts or oral traditions, but we're doubtless that many a nightcore fan is spiritual. These pieces were created in order to attenuate noise during seances, allowing one to come closer with the spirit realm.\nThe recordings themselves have only been shared on tape among in-the-know nightcore fans, but we've received permission from a certain archivist to release them to the general public. These recordings are considered sacred, and should be listened to with the the utmost care. However, we've also chosen to include a club friendly remix commissioned from veteran post-nightcore musician, Fuuka ASMR. We hope this trip into nightcore esotericism doesn't lead you down a dangerous path as the recordings themselves are associated with at least 9 deaths.\nHRR19",

They were active on YouTube throughout most of their musical career, however their videos are considered lost.\nThe few tracks on this EP are excerpts from a selection of their videos that were recently discovered on an archival website. They have been ripped in 1080p and monitored in soundgoodizer to ensure to highest quality HD audio sound.\nHRR02",

            "about": "The Headspace duo Tatiana and Laura C. return with their 5th LP as the Crushing Union. The duo have dubbed their slow abrasive drone style as \"dirge\" music.\n\"Dirge is a sound I came up with to describe what we were doing with the Crushing Union releases. We'd make these original compositions and slow them down until they were these brutal artifacted industrial beats, the more slow and extreme a track is the more dirge it is.\" Says Laura C. who is definitely a real person.\nWhile Crushing Union V is a softer dirge release (Calculated at being only 56% dirge), the duo hope it serves a pleasant example of the style.\nHRR46",

Sad, but the great thing is all the cool stuff that comes afterwards. We won't be around to see, but someone will be there to enjoy it all, eventually, maybe... We like to be positive here!!!!! PA based new-age duo Crushing Union imagine a new alien future devoid of human life but just as \"verdant\" in their debut release.\nHRR22",

            "about": "Texhychytol is a 24 year old musician from Achorage specializing in a dance fusion nightcore. She entered the music game at a young age, creating her first purely electronic song when she was on 10. Since then, she has gained slightly stronger opinions. Texhychytol says she makes music to capture the sound of being \"bored on the internet\".\nIf there's one thing she wants to get out of this release, it's \"money\".\nNot sure why she's making music for indie netlables if she wants money.\nArt by: MC469  twitter.com/god469suck\nSpecial thanks to Yakui for providing a remix.\nHRR18",

            "about": "After a protracted legal battle, Frederika Felicia Montero \"Fuuka ASMR\" Fasmr has regained the rights to NXCXTC from the Tennessee Nightcore Producer's Union. It was a long battle that cost both Fuuka ASMR and HRR management over $78 million dollar in legal fees and damages. We're all pretty traumatized after the long court process, especially since the court caught fire several times due to reasons unrelated to the trial. But we're fine, we're dry now, and we're in a warm place where intellectual property laws can't find us.\nEnjoy NXCXTC EP, now freely available in the first of many coming re-releases and featuring the rare track, Senki Rave.\nHRRE01",

Poyo Mix is their first mix that is readily available for consumption by the Western world. In their own words, Poyo Mix is best described as the \"awkward in-betweens\" of nightcore.\nTaking influence from first wave nightcore, vaporwave, and even the stylings of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Poyo Mix is DJ Poyo POYO's first official step into a style of nightcore they've dubbed \"Aniwave\".\nHRR01",

Billed as reflections on her life all but falling apart after the release of her smash hit pop nightcore EP, NXCXTC, Fuuka ASMR takes a complete 180 in both the meaning and sound of her music while still totally being nightcore. You definitely can't play these at a club, but sometimes it's just nice to sit back and listen to things by yourself or with close friends and business associates.\nHRR21",

Currently based out of the server room of an abandoned office building located in Cambria County, Yakui has molded a fusionist hardcore sound strictly grounded in the culture and land of modern rural Pennsylvanian youth. Dubbed \"Soultek\" this high-energy release is meant to raise the spirits of the listener, both figuratively and literally. The presence of anomalous binaural beats which resonate with the souls of [EXPUNGED] have lead to this albums preemptive banning in the countries of [EXPUNGED], [EXPUNGED], and [REDACTED]. We take no responsibility for incidences of mania or extreme violence that may occur from the playing of this album. Remember, HRR loves you.\nHRR23",

Apparently haunted and cursed, speedlove\\\\ has passed through the hands of many a nightcore DJ. Nobody who has come into possession of this EP has lived, but we here at Horrible Recordings are hoping to defy the unfathomable laws of the cosmos with this release.\nAn eclectic mix of both experimental and traditional nightcoring techniques, speedlove\\\\ is enough to make both hardcore nightcore fans and newcomers go wild. That's both figurative and literal.\nsoundcloud.com/fatherfake\nHRR05",

However, whatever your opinion on Fuuka ASMR may be, her approach towards production is philosophically to that of nightcore's forebearers.\nSquishy Moments is a collection of long sought after Fuuka ASMR tracks. Usually placed at the end of nightcore mixes as \"set closers\", the Squishy Moments collection have remained exclusive only to top nightcore DJs until now.\nHRR03",

            "about": "DJ Witchy Dreams is the alias of a producer and long time friend of the label who prefers to stay anonymous. For a short period of time in the early 2010s he created these tracks in hopes of becoming a gabber DJ. These tracks were shared anonymously on a number of sites dedicated to music and nerdy culture, but never caught on.\nHis dreams of being a famous gabber DJ never came true however, and he now has moved on to working in the much more respectable genre of hyperpop. Still, Mr. Witchy Dreams wished with all his heart that this EP could be released even if no one knew he made it. We (Tiana) at HRR had to oblige and bring these cutesy tracks to the public eye.\nHRR45",
