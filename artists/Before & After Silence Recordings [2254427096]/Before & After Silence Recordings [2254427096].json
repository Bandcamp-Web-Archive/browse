            "about": "A Distant Reflection was originally written and recorded in 2020 and was originally released as a long form digital release only. Clocking in at almost 60 minutes long \"A Distant Reflection\" explores the relationship between deep shifting atmospheric synth drones, unusual found sounds/field recordings and emotive improvised key sections that bring a sense of stillness and subtle emotional impact.\nUpon its original release the feedback from various supporters was very strong and it has been one of those digital pieces that some have requested a physical CD release on a few occasions and as a personal favourite I felt it was time to release it on CD.\nSome of the supporters feedback on the original release.\nmickchillage.bandcamp.com/album/a-distant-reflection\nb_d:\nI slept so well! really chilled and wonderful :-)\nAmbientcosmos:\nBeautiful, drifting, immersive soundscape.\nDimitar_Dodovski:\nSoothing, pastel cloud of ambient tones reminiscent of Eno's Apollo. Its floating and cycling quality makes it suitable for thinking, relaxation or art installation!\nDavid Prescott:\nAn absolutely favorite from one of my absolute favorites. An excellent long-form ambient track from a master of the genre.\nFor this 2023 CD release I decided to return to the track and I have made some subtle changes to the mix and arrangement. the addition of further stereo enhancement, additional FX sweeps giving it a more dream like essence in certain moments and changing the end with the reappearance of the improvised piano as the track fades away.\nTo fill the CD I've also included two brand new compositions which I feel compliment the title track but also stand on their own as shorter pieces.\nThe album \"A Distant Reflection\" clocks in at almost 8o minutes of somewhat personal thought provoking reflective ambience to immerse yourself in.\nI hope you enjoy this new version and its accompanying pieces.\nMick Chillage\nMay 2023",

            "about": "The alias \"Initial Programs\" is a Mick Chillage project and was born in late 2016 after creating a track where all the sounds were created from scratch, basically from the default Initialised program setting of my Mopho X4 synth along with my MS20 mini etc.\nThe track I created appeared to have a lot of my electronic music genre influences, Techno, Electro, touches of the IDM movement, Ambient, Acid, so I thought to myself, wouldn't it be an interesting project to create a release that brings together as many of my influences as possible by merging them into each track.\nIn 2017 I had finished the first EP and this was released through First Cut on 12\" vinyl in early 2018 and was very well received from many well known Techno & Electro DJ's and producers. This kept the momentum going to hopefully create an albums worth of material.\nSo over the last few years I continued randomly producing works with this alias in mind with the hope of producing a full length album and by early 2022 I began selecting tracks to make a coherent album.\nAugust 2023 finally sees the release \"Are We Programmed\" a twelve track album that features the three tracks from the EP for First time on CD and nine new previously unreleased works.",

            "about": "In 2018 I released \"Between The Endless Silence\" on Carpe Sonum Novum. This album was a collection of Improvised Piano based ambient works that I had created between 2015 to 2016.\nShortly after these works were completed and selected for the album I continued to work with this momentum of piano based improvisation pieces into 2017 where the body of what is now on \"Between Moments\" was pretty much completed.\nThe original five pieces clocked in closer to one hundred minutes of music which was way too long for a single CD release and I was very happy with how these pieces had turned out I waited until the right time came along to release on CD.\nI put this project away [on hold] for some time but it was never forgotten and it would regularly pop back into my mind that I would need to complete it and arrange it for a CD release.\nIn 2022 I returned to it over a period of time and re-arranged some tracks to get it just under 80 mins, luckily no musical elements were lost and I was very careful not to loose any of the tracks emotional. atmospheric impact during the edits.\n2024 I return to it again with fresh ears and fix some mixing details and issues. By early spring I'm very happy with the new arrangements, mix etc and decide this will be the 2nd release of 2024 on Before & After Silence Recordings.",

            "about": "Brain Oscillations is a return perhaps to a more Ambient Space Music aesthetic after the rather organic and poignant piano based \"Urban Nature\" although I would consider this more like head space music.\nThe initial impetus of this release was born from the sad passing of Klaus Schulze an artist that was synonymous with the \"Kosmische Musik\" of the early 70's and someone who was very much regarded as one of the true pioneers of this music which spawned from the early experimental kraut rock movement in Germany.\nThe passing of Klaus had shocked and moved the electronic music scene across the board, his trademark hypnotic sequences had left a huge influence on the dance music scene that emerged in the 80's and continues today which is why he was given the hefty title of \"The Godfather Of Techno\" but there was so much more to his music than this.\nSo, upon his passing I found myself revisiting some of his works and reading the liner notes of a particular album Klaus had described his style of music creation as \"Brain Oscillations\" this very distinct & descriptive term got me thinking about possible music that may inspire me and perhaps be my own homage to his influence.\nAt first I thought it would probably be just one piece of music if I was lucky enough to get inspired. The first track I created which is the opening piece was born from the deep ascending shifting poly synth sound I had created from on my Prophet Rev2 that appears at the twelve minute mark. I turned to my trusty Moog Grandmother and built up a selection of various modulated frequencies, these formed the slowly developing intro of the track as more sustained poly drones & classic sounding synth parts etc were added. The bones of track one was developed in one evening.\nI also made a conscious decision not to use any sequenced synth parts as I felt this would have been the most obvious element to emulate but instead to use lengthy poly synth chords, drones, keys, leads and wild synth modulations that suggest a burst of neuron activity or that may stimulate the mind on a sensory & emotional level.\nLuckily this mindset of creative thinking led me to completing two other tracks within a short time frame which I felt had a strong continuous theme.\nFor KS.\nEquipment used on this album.\nDave Smith Prophet Rev2\nMoog Grandmother\nKorg MS20 Mini\nEmu ESI 4000 sampler\nElectro Magnetic contact Mic\nAcoustic Guitar\nAbleton Live 10 for audio sequences mix and digital FX & treatments.",

            "about": "Celestial Observations was created in Autumn 2020, the album only utilises sounds that came from my various synthesizers.\nWhat started out as experiment with layering monophonic drones, created mainly on the Moog grandmother at first it developed by various modulation patching of each part the sound would morph and change over time.\nI recorded these long droning/morphing passages and eventually built on top of these foundations with some polyphonic patches I created on the Prophet Rev2 & Novation Supernova.\nIn some pieces however they only consist of monophonic sounds, on tracks one & four.\nWithin a few weeks I had the bones of an album, six tracks in all but I narrowed it down to five pieces, the omitted piece will be used elsewhere in the future. I felt these works definitely had an other worldly expanse to them and had a sense of dark & light and gave me a feeling of exploring the vastness of universe & beyond.\nThe title \"Celestial Observations\" seemed apt\nI hope you enjoy my return to the more \"Space Ambient\" spectrum on this album\nMick Chillage\nFeb 2021.",

            "about": "Devotology is the study of cosmic devotion, its role in the achievement of astrosis and devotional practice in Astronism.\n\"Devotology\" was created between late 2022 and 2023. I initially composed and recorded \"Polytheism\" in December 2022 as a ten minute dark drone Ambient piece and returned to it a few months later and was inspired to add more synth parts and keys etc which progressed the track with a deeper spiritual or other worldly sensibility I bounced back and forth between other projects and built the final mix and arrangement knowing that it felt like the beginning of a possible theme.\nTrack three came next \"Auroral Devotion\" [but under a different working title] in April 2023 some random sound design experimentation lead me to the main shifting polyphonic pad drone, I kept doodling and experimenting with various other synths and played various parts until I arrived pretty quickly with part 1 of this piece.\nI sensed that the track could be longer but I didn't want to just simply arrange the existing elements as they where so I got heavily into playing around with the source material which was purely analogue to began with.\nI decided to explore within the digital realm to achieve an unusual mood and aesthetic for the second part that subtly mutates & drifts into other sonic dimensions.\nThe final piece to be recorded was track three \"Sol\" recored in late summer of 2023 which was inspired by the sound of my malfunctioning Solar panel pump system which was in need of a service. I climbed into my attic storage space with my Zoom H1 recorder and captured various cycles the pump was now making, these unusual sounds became drones and eerie mechanical pulses which where looped and manipulated in various ways. The addition of some poly synth parts, mono leads and FX added a more musical feel to the strange foundations.\nThe idea that this sound came from my solar panel system and basically the power of the sun made me think about our brightest star and how important it is for our existence and it led me to the concept of an album based on ancient and modern worship of celestial bodies in their many forms.\nI saw a connection between the other tracks that somehow had a cosmic fascination and everything just fell into place it seemed.",

            "about": "In 2011 I fulfilled an artistic dream to release music through one of my most influential electronic artist Pete Namlook and his cult label Fax records, whom I'd been following/supporting passionately for almost 20 years.\nIn very early summer of 2011 I compiled a selection of tracks which I felt had a certain Fax aesthetic or influence yet had my own sonic feel, I nervously sent these to Pete.\nHe kindly messaged me and said he would listen within a few days, which he did. His response came something as a shock as he was really into the demo and wanted to release it within a month to wrap up his usual summer break.\nInitially I was perhaps expecting that if he was to like it that he may suggest some additional changes like shorten some tracks or maybe such a track could benefit with another musical element or mix. Pete was ready to master the album straight away and I trusted his ears and impeccable taste that it was perfect as it was. I did not in anyway want to suggest that perhaps some additional time could be spent on one or two tracks incase I missed an opportunity to release on Fax records.\nPete and myself discussed some possible fitting titles, he had said that upon listening to it at first he felt it was like hearing a lost live recording that perhaps himself and Tetsu could have recorded yet it was something new also and it it felt like it was a glimpse of the past, the present and maybe the future of the Fax sound and as the twentieth anniversary was approaching this landed perfectly and Pete suggested \"FAXology\" and I sat with it for a day or two and it just seemed to fit with everything.\nSo, \"FAXology\" was released on Fax in June of 2011. it was my second full length CD album and it helped hugely with getting my name as an established Ambient/electronica artist.\nOver the years I had contemplated a re-issue as original copies are rare and fetch collector prices on sites like Discogs etc. A version appeared on my 09-19 CD box set but it has not been available separately.\nIn 2020 I set up Before & After Silence Recordings and i had stated that I would reissue some albums \"FAXology\" was high on my list but in 2019 due to a violent thunderstorm my old laptop and connected hard drive suffered a catastrophic frying form lightning that struck the house.\nI believed that all of the old project files were lost forever.\nCut to 2021 and during some renovations at the house I dug out an old box of cables and other old computer peripherals from my attic storage, in the bottom of the box there was a USB stick, curiously I plugged it in only to find a folder that read \"Live sets\" I opened it and there was pretty much all of the tracks from \"FAXology\" in a live session capacity.\nOver the next few months I painstakingly reworked all of the tracks within Ableton to match the arrangements of the original CD but making some improvements to the overall mix, enhancing the stereo panning and movement, utilising individual effects for each channel as I now have a much more powerful Mac rather than using sends from two master effects channels. Some more subtle differences in the arrangements and use of filters etc.\nTrack four \"Control Room\" was always one I felt could have been expanded on, I like the original and its rather minimal feel but for the 2022 version I added some additional sparse sounds.\nI still hold a huge lot of love for the original mix and master but wanted to give fans something a little more with this re-issue rather than just repressing it with the original wavs. I was fortunate to have Lorenzo Montana on mastering duties, Lorenzo whom is a brilliant solo artist but also worked close with Pete on the excellent Labyrinth series it felt right to have someone to sprinkle that final bit of sonic magic to this new mix of \"FAXology\"\nRevisiting this album was a joy to rebuild and work on, I was careful to make the changes very subtle but hope that those who enjoy the original will find something new and enhanced that makes the listening experience all the more rewarding and also I hope that maybe a new audience will discover and enjoy it.\nTo Peter Kuhlmann I am eternally grateful.\nMick Chillage Dublin October 2022.",

            "about": "October 2021 sees the release of “Growth” on CD & Digital which was originally released in two parts digitally in 2020.\nThe inspiration came about while on a walk around my local park and across its rather brutal looking metal suspension footbridge which spans across the river below. I noticed the growth of lichen on its surface. I was taken by the bright yellow fungi contrasting against the wine coloured painted metal supports and the black slip resistant walkway. I felt this would make a nice photograph, so I took a picture with my phone.\nThe image lingered in my brain and I was fascinated how the lichen was taking over the bridge on certain surfaces, almost as if it was trying to blend the alien structure to its natural surroundings.\nI began to see a connection between nature's ability to grow in the most unexpected environments and how growth can happen to us in unexpected situations also, particularly poignant in the current pandemic, for many this has been a challenging time but also its been a time of growth as we discover that maybe we should be doing things different in our lives.\nThis inspired me to work on a new piece of music.\nThe title \"Growth\" seemed to fit as the track grew from an unusual sonic foundation just like the lichen had grown on the metal of the very industrial and brutal looking footbridge at my park.\nGrowth Part 2 came shortly after the first one, although a completely new composition it seemed to connect with the first one, another recent walk in my park and I noticed that one of the trees had a very tiny branch growing, on this infantile branch were some rather large new leaves. Strangely this was Autumn and whilst most leaves were dying these leaves were very green & luscious. I took a photo and some days later a new piece of music began to emerge.\nSo now I present “Growth” Parts 1 & 2 on one CD for the first time and in digital that\nClock in at approximately seventy eight minutes.\nMick Chillage October 2021",

            "about": "Inter-Dimensional Guidance was written & recorded in Autumn of 2022, it was one of those albums that seemed to arrive almost out of nowhere.\nMost of the time when I create music I prefer to start with a blank canvas with no real preconceived idea of what i want to achieve. The title track started out as just an experiment with my Moog Grandmother, creating drones that shift in tone by using the modulation matrix and the mod wheel to accurately achieve the desired tone and add movement.\nOnce I had arrived at the various desired drones I captured these in audio and then I instinctively edited and played what you hear as the track progresses.\nThe title track was pretty much written arranged and recorded over two nights, this was definitely the impetus to an unaware trajectory of creativity that continued over the following two weeks or so where the four following tracks emerged and I began to realise that a potential thematic album had emerged, almost as if I had been guided by an unknown outside force.\nThe themes within the album appear to be somewhat mysterious, otherworldly and perhaps those that explore other dimensions and spaces. It's strange that this album came together just as I was ready to release the newly mixed version of my FAXology album, is \"Inter-Dimensional Guidance\" the result of a subconscious desire to fulfil an often requested sequel to the album FAXology?\nMaybe or maybe not.\nEither way I hope you enjoy my latest deep & explorative album!\nMick Chillage\nFebruary 2023",

            "about": "July 2021 see’s the fourth release on Before & After Silence Recordings.\nJouhatsu (Japanese: 蒸発, \"evaporation\") or johatsu refers to the people in Japan who purposely vanish from their established lives without a trace. However this phenomenon can be seen all over the world.\nA recent conversation with a friend on social media led me to a documentary on Youtube which focused on the culture which is prevalent in Japan, it followed various peoples stories;\nThose who have arranged their own evaporation and those who are searching for missing loved ones, I found these accounts to be incredibly sad yet fascinating, that in this modern\nage of information that someone could start a completely new life without a trace.\nThis phenomenon of Jouhatsu resonated with me & various tracks that I composed after viewing the documentary seemed to be of a similar tone/emotion, almost reflecting what It must be like for those forced into such drastic measures to leave a life & loved ones behind, to start again and also not forgetting the turmoil & anguish of those left in the dark regarding the whereabouts of someone they care about.\nThe seven distinct pieces of “Jouhatsu” appear to tell a story of their own, although I was not particularly aware of this during the creative process. It was sitting down and selecting the various works that I began to realise that a coherent sonic narrative had developed.\nMick Chillage July 2021",

The track has been revisited for the 2021 release with some edits and arrangements & the addition of two new tracks that compliment the main long form piece.\n“MS-V-MS” sees Mick exploring a tapestry of spaced out Acidic synth lines, haunting Ambient tones that shift & morph into passages of dark ominous analogue swells & Intricate poly rhythms with a driving industrial presence. Resulting in a flowing marriage of IDM intensity & otherworldly ambience.\nThe title track started out using just two analogue mono synths The Korg MS20 Mini & the Doepfer MS-404 hence the title. Other synths & various production techniques were used to complete the piece.",

Overall I feel this is more of a refined version of the track that rises from moments of frenetic energy to almost silent calm.",

Otkyo got inspiration from a field recording session from Dublin city, passing roadworks etc, its mix of detailed beat mangling, deep bass & large analogue swells and digitally manipulated melodies and moments of dub style echo's makes this one of my more experimental IDM pieces in recent years. It seemed to work as a shorter companion to the lengthy opening track.",

            "about": "In late 2022 I acquired my sisters old acoustic guitar and set about with the intention to firstly experiment with it for some sonic textures that may sit with certain projects. Over sometime I began to develop some themes or compositions within my limited playing ability, however I was quite pleased with the emotions that they appeared to convey.\nDuring this period, naturally I had accumulated various synth based ambient works that covered various themes and moods and I also played some acoustic moments with certain pieces.\nCut to summer of 2023 I now had what felt like the foundation for a new album that included a mix of pure synth based ambient and some with the acoustic guitar taking centre stage & a mix of both approaches.\nI knew this was going to be a bit of leap for me releasing this to the world as I'm mainly known for purely electronic based music with occasional filed recordings and electroacoustic & found sounds.\nHowever, from an artists point of view its always being important for me to grow in someway, take risks, jump genres etc so I decided to complete this collection of pieces and present a new album! The last part of the creative process was creating a title, as the album displays varying themes that conjure, memories. environments, mind states & emotions I was mindful not to use specific words that may sway the listener to thinking of a particular sonic narrative.\nEventually I arrived with the title \"Points Of Gradations\" as I see this collection as another point in my creative artistic journey. The title also leaves plenty of space for the listeners mind to wander and create what ever feelings, images they wish.\nMick Chillage\nJanuary 2025.",

            "about": "In July of 2020 I released a digital only version of “So Far From Home” it was a return to a “Space Music” style which I’m probably best known for with my release “FAXology”\nThe track was a synergy of both Analogue & Digital synths, some found sounds & sound bites that I had collected over time, I initially built a foundation of various hums/drones manipulated machine-like sounds etc and then added more musical themes that gave a sense of being transported through deep space with only the mechanical & electronic sounds of the hi tech craft to keep you company.\nI felt it was important to convey some varying emotional moods; as on this journey you encounter various majestic phenomena with a sense of wonder with moments of loneliness and uncertainty as you venture further out into the vastness of uncharted space.\nThree distinct movements morph & shift during its fifty five minute duration.\n“So Far From Home” was quite a popular digital release and I had some requests about a CD release at some point. I returned to the track in early jan of 2022 and after composing the accompanying track “Dreams Of Our Blue Planet'' in Dec of 2021, Which I felt like it belonged within the same sonic universe.\nFor the CD release I went back and reworked the mix, giving some sounds more prominence and expanding the stereo mIx, additional automated panning on certain sounds along with some subtle tweaks to the arrangement and FX enhancement, which introduces some unheard tones from the original synth experimentation sessions.\nI am now delighted to present this new CD Mix version of “So Far From Home” along with a brand new track “Dreams Of Our Blue Planet” which clocks in at just over twenty minutes with an emotive and deeply atmospheric aesthetic.\nMick Chillage Feb 2022",

            "about": "“Tides Of Melancholy” will be released just on the first anniversary of Before & After Silence Recordings in early January 2022 and it will be the sixth CD on the label. The album consists of five Ambient pieces of varying lengths, three of which were composed in 2021.\nThe three pieces I composed in 2021 seemed to fit within a particular emotive narrative and sonic aesthetic. I saw a connection with the piece “Footsteps In Fog '' track three which I had written after the passing of Harold Budd in 2020, strangely at the time of writing the piece I felt it could possibly be part of an album at some point.\nTrack one “Submerged Cathedrals” came about rather quickly, some sonic experimentation led me to an almost human-like tonal quality that I played on the keys. This inspired me, adding more keys, piano, strings and deeper synths. The track conveys a mournful feel, like a once beautiful structure that is vividly remembered but is now lost forever in deep murky waters and its haunting sentiments sets the tone of the album.\nTrack Two “One Sanguine Day” seems to shift between a certain sombre tone and shifts with moments that shimmer with light and a sense of hope.\nThe title track “Tides Of Melancholy” feels like a soundtrack to a series of filmic snapshots from deep within a melancholic state of mind as it slowly builds and shifts to a layered tapestry of emotive tone and colour.\nThe closing-piece “Arc Of Light” was originally Written and recorded in late 2019. It’s somewhat Electro-Acoustic, Neoclassical and subtle synthesised elements with the eventual emergence of a jazz influenced rhythm and bass combo lifts the track almost as if the melancholic state of mind Has subsided and finishes the theme and concept of the album\nIn a fitting way.\nMick Chillage\nDecember 2021",

            "about": "Towards the end of 2019 I wrote & recorded Two Days part 1\nat this point it was just titled \"Two Days\" as I had not intended to compose a second part. My initial idea was to perhaps to do a series of long form works which would be released in the digital format, providing the inspiration continued to flow. In early 2020 I released \"Two Days Pt 1\" on bandcamp only and the response and support seemed very positive.\nA few more long form works happened from week to week and then the Covid Pandemic lock down arrived, I found myself out of work as many others did and my long form works seemed to be a nice antidote for many who now found themselves in a new and very uncertain routine.\nMany people asked if I planned to release these works on CD, which I liked the possibility of, however due to the proficient output of my work I doubted that any labels could take it on, so I decided to launch my own label to release these works. The original \"Two Days\" clocks in at 40 minutes so I decided that I would return to the piece and re work it and include a second part to give my fans/followers something extra if they wish to purchase the CD and also to utilise the space on the format.",

            "about": "“Urban Nature” was recorded in late spring/early summer of 2021\nand was inspired by a wonderful section of wild land known as the\n“The River Dodder Valley Park” that sits between two urban locations near my home. The Dodder river springs from the Dublin mountains, the park is full of wildlife and has a path that runs through it for about 5km, which has recently been expanded.\nI’ve always found it fascinating that this thriving natural habitat sits near dual carriageways, the M50 motorway, its flyovers, local shopping centres and even a cement plant nearby. There's a waterfall and a weir and remnants of the old canal system that led from the old developing Tallaght village to the heart of Dublin's city centre.\nSo armed with my Zoom portable recorder I gathered lots of various recordings, nature and urban sounds and they inspired me to improvise over these elements using keys, mainly virtual piano and subtle synths & effects etc. The music would sit along the lines of modern/minimal classical and perhaps inspired by Harold Budd, Brian Eno etc.\nI tried to capture certain locations along this path with certain sonic aesthetics. Part 3 for example was inspired by a large electrical pylon that sits close to the river bank and its heavy cables span across the river. Birds nest nearby and I can imagine the possible electrical interference that the various animals may hear or feel so the piano part modulates and gets almost lost at times with a slightly unsettling level of interference & unnatural noise.\nUltimately I created the album to be listened to in one sitting, trying to capture a soundtrack to the 5-6km walk with the different sounds and feelings you may gather from these polar opposite environments coexisting, so the CD is mixed as one track but each piece is easily identifiable as they start and end.\nThe individual tracks are offered digitally and come with the purchase of the CD at bandcamp.\nThe album is dedicated to the memory of Steve Brown.\nMick Chillage\nApril 2022",
