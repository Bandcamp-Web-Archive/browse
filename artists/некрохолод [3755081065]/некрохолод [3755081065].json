            "about": "In the quiet and cold sounds, the shimmers of a minor piano sound, lies the deep history of the experience of a place that man once called home.\nThe album begins with subtle cold drones describing the former echoes of life in desolate places, moving seamlessly into a lullaby-like piano sound that fades into a fragmented sound of desolation with fragments of field sounds. A hazy and cold fear, an expression that grows deeper into the next track, where the listener is greeted by a minimalistic dark ambient sound with an unsettling build-up of bass lines and the coming of echoing human voices. The end of the album is infused in the sound of field recordings joined with a frozen and wistful piano sound that brings the album to a conclusion. At the end one no longer hears anxiety, pain, longing, only reminiscence and coldness against the quiet tides of the northern seas.\nAs the author himself pointed out, the sound of this album can be expressed in the lines:\n‘With tired eyes he looked into that silent wasteland, into that icy night enveloping him in the cold wind that kept the memory of the former home in that place...’",

The expression of the lived experience came in the sound, which, through sublimation and the desire to convey the gravity of the painting, resulted in a flowing river of sound in the album.",

            "about": "Who am I?\nA truly difficult question — one that remains unanswered even after decades of exploring information and creating various forms of art that emerge from within me into the world.\nI began creating at the intersection of emptiness and curiosity — a desire to understand why what I feel can exist at all in this reality. What universal laws could have shaped my ability to feel the cold and to contemplate the boundless ice of the sky above the steppe?\nOut of that cold and the absence of a sense of reality, the art project “Khladna reka” was born. Its purpose was to document the atmospheres that brought me into a state of belonging to something higher and voidlike. It became my first true step toward creating something meaningful — the foundation of my perception not only of art, but of closeness itself.\nThere is nothing that could describe my fundamentally emotional perception of this world better than this album. It is a sonic visualization of my documentary and autobiographical project “Khladna reka.”\nAnd you know, sometimes I feel that no matter where I go or how I change, I will always remain there — within those native, cold atmospheres.\nIt is worth noting that there is no sorrow or darkness here, as one might think from the album’s somber tones. It is merely a method of expression, one of the ways to immerse oneself in what shaped me. In a sense, this is simply the sonic embodiment of my writings about self-awareness.\nYet, while exploring such deep layers of another’s reality, each of us may find a chance to reconsider our own — and of course, never forget the old and faithful resonance.\nPlease, as you listen to this album, remain as open and sincere as possible in your feelings, emotions, and sensations. Just let the sound flow through you.\nThank you.",

            "about": "Through the north to the edge of the earth, through the chilling fear of age-old and age-old cold, in the endless wasteland of ice and dead lands. The author presents the listener to towering experimental electronic and ambient sounds that transport them to the most abandoned lands of permafrost and forest silence. primordiality, a place where no man has ever set foot, only the dominance of nature frozen in the early centuries of creation and the cradle of life. Listeners encounter electronic and conventionally synthesized sounds, unusual for this artist, in synergy with cold ambient and field recordings of northern winds. Regardless of the sounds that are unusual for his genre, the author achieves drama and cinematic sound, which allows one to fully and deeply feel the author's message and predisposition to the vastness of the Arctic frozen in centuries.",

            "about": "This album is a collection of luminous sensations — subtle, often inconspicuous. Each composition reflects a facet of this spectrum — that very brightness I’ve managed to preserve, to recognize, to gather piece by piece through different periods of life.\nIt wasn’t always easy, because what is bright often reveals itself not in the loud, but in the quiet. It’s easy to miss, to mistake for something else, not to understand right away what’s worth holding on to. Sometimes it hid in pain, sometimes in silence, sometimes in things I didn’t see the value of at the time.\nBut over time, these fragments began to come together. Not into something finished, but into a shape I now feel as my own. This album is not an attempt to capture something final, but a way to give form to one of those depths that have become my core. A part I will carry through everything — living, dead, and reborn.",
