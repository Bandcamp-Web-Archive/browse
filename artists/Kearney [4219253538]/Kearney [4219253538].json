Seems routine to me Nothing here left to see, folks You can move along I'm just glad they got here in time To see us fade from the limelight I wish we had more to show for it than A cruddy book of poems and  A torn dress underneath my winter coat I'm not one to gloat But if the going gets tough should we get going? Isn't that what you said before we left? If something bad were to happen We could try it all again And again And again And again And again And again And again And again, and... Seems routine to me Nothing here left to see, folks You can move along I'm just glad they got here in time To see us fade from the limelight, but If our flame dies We've got another try Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless Unless Unless Unless you lied Unless Unless Unless you lied Unless you lied",

Isn't that what you said before we left? If something bad were to happen We could try it all again And again And again And again And again And again And again And again, and... Seems routine to me Nothing here left to see, folks You can move along I'm just glad they got here in time To see us fade from the limelight, but If our flame dies We've got another try Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless you lied Unless Unless Unless Unless you lied Unless Unless Unless you lied Unless you lied",

The burning and the electricity Sun goes down San Francisco Friends are hard to find Chew them up just as quick as I can catch them Try to clear my mind Remember hours at the table Gauze white light easing through If there's one thing I'm not gonna do tonight It's die for you And when you speak it's those two  Who speak through you Who'll speak for me?

CALM DOWN -- this is a song about having an anxiety attack in a car, and realizing that the person driving does not know how to help you when you're having an anxiety attack in a car\n2. INTRO -- this is a song about a town in california\n3. FRESNO -- this is a song about trusting someone who's older than you, because they're older and you're younger\n4. QUICK STOP IN NEEDLES -- this is a song about having to trust someone who's younger than you, even though you're older and they're younger\n5. SATELLITE RADIO -- this is a song about someone inconsiderately making it difficult for you to drown them out with the volume knob\n6. CHINO -- this is a song about heat\n7. INTERLUDE -- this is a song about wanting to go somewhere else\n8. 1976 -- this is a song about something bad that happened a long time ago, somewhere else\n9.

PALINDROME ROAD -- this is a song about how when you try to drive from chowchilla, ca to the mexican border, you realize that every highway in california loops back in on itself, which makes it very hard to leave california\n12. END -- this is a song about crying, because you're finally happy, while the ship sinks\nif you listen to CHOWCHILLA while driving through california, CHOWCHILLA will become as long as your drive\n----------->  goo.gl/maps/sWdPdYA49AE2",

There are all these big tall trees And call me crazy But I don't think I could live in a tree For very long I hop in his Saturn, like the car  Not like a Dreamcast And we cross into the trees Who-o-o-o-o-oa And we meet at Rulli's I get a pastry or two And I smile for both of you I get a bottle of the fizzy drink That tastes like orange Not like Sunkist But the orange taste like adults would like And I feel so free There's no way to see through me And I'm even smiling When Mom finally leaves I can't climb those stairs on my own On my own",

I know that I'll be fine But honestly I wish you were dead And I'm the only thing that stands Between you and the grave So take your best shot and leave me With all the mistakes I have made I'm sorry if my detours frighten You know I didn't mean what I just said And I'm sure if we just stay together One of these days our luck will come out ahead And there's a price tag in the window Its numbers climbing up And there's two mannequins on the sidewalk Collecting coins in a cup",

Why are you laughing? Can't you tell my brave face Is this close to cracking? Who?  Who are you when you dream? Are you big? Are you strong? Are you smarter than you seem? Are you at one with yourself? Are you finally free? Can't you tell these feelings Have been destroying me? When I look into your eyes I can't see you looking back My hands go numb My heart gets slack I'm fine When? When will this end? It might not sound pretty But I really need a friend Where? Where am I headed? As long as it's away from you I can't believe I said it I can't believe in you anymore I can't let this be my life I can't hold onto my hopes much longer All my agony and all my strife  It doesn't boil over It doesn't scream It just stays hidden Can you teach me how to dream?

I'm losing track of what you -- Don't mention it, we're fine here You had a crush on who? I swear I didn't know But that was in the past and Gee, I do agree Nice guys finish last It's such a shame but honestly You're better off without me I was so superficial Sensitive is sexy, yeah And I'd love to stay and chat  But I've got big plans to prepare Think fireworks (BLAM BLAM BLAM) Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you Anyways, I must be going Nice to talk to you again It's been so long and I feel so bad But you're such an awesome friend Do you know I get sad sometimes? That's silly, you won't But the main reason I remember you Is this deep, abiding, self-defeating dream I keep having",

What would I do with money? Don't you think that's funny? That every time a child dies  An angel gets its wings When our river runs red All the choirs sing I'd go down instead of up Since I pulled the trigger  But you'd all cash out Move onto something bigger I don't want something bigger And if God takes a million every other day Then who will care when the getaway driver Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five  Takes five We'll drive past the ocean West, out to the ocean And then north, along the ocean I feel the ocean Just a single sharp breath  Before my eyes shut tight A spin to the left  And everything's alright A couple seconds down And a few more gasping The sound of all our troubles Finally collapsing  And when the verse ends All the angels commend Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Good job Dave Hip hip hooray And if God takes a million every other day Then who will care when the getaway driver Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five Takes five",

It's with this rare perspective that I'm Confident in saying I'm better off dead And should you ever start to miss me All you have to do Is remember what I've said And you might never ever move past The pain that you felt But as long as I'm here in the ground Then all the cards are dealt Good luck God speed Keep up Happy I need A break Like every Body Please record My final message to you Just before I hit the ground without you And it ends We were always looking for A way to end So I guess we got our wish So that's -- I remember What I was gonna say You're a loser, who'd have thought? Honestly it's plain as day I'd love to tell you that See your neck flab tense But remember fireworks? (BLAM BLAM BLAM) Use a bit of common sense Anyways, I must be going Wish I'd said what I had meant Good thing I'm working on A fast track to repent Do you know  I'll spend all my time Sitting in the dark? But an eternity of what lies beyond Is better than staring at your face Since I'm in a better place All your bullshit Falling away I'm in a better place, and I'm fine Look The traffic's thinning Is this what it feels like When you're winning? I Can't be guilty anymore But I wish you the best Walk on through that door And leave And watch me leave Sink into the bay I guess we all just have One last thing to say That whatever you do  Don't let the world call you broken Everyone'll try But the truth is unspoken If anybody says It's a drag to be alive Just remember the time The getaway driver took five Took five Took five Took five Took five Took five Took five Took five",

            "about": "This album is called MANUAL BIOGRAPHY. It has twelve songs on it that I, Kearney, wrote, sang, et cetera. I wrote the songs over several months and then recorded them over several days. Occasionally on this album you will hear two voices at once. On other occasions, you will hear more than two voices at once, and sometimes those voices will sound different. You should not be alarmed by this. I, Kearney, am solely responsible for the vocals herein, on every single one of the album’s twelve songs. It is also true that, at first glance, MANUAL BIOGRAPHY may appear “personal.” Despite its first appearance, MANUAL BIOGRAPHY is deeply impersonal. It follows the life of a person whom I’ve never met, but after spending all this time in their head, I can only wish them the very best of luck.",

I won't risk a first impression The contents herein are underlined by someone The signature is messy but it makes a deep depression Turn through the pages As fast as the notebook can handle Is she smart for her age Or is she an obtuse angle? If you see any similarities  Don't hesitate to tell me why This is just a first draft, I'm still working out the kinks And by the time I'm done you will hardly recognize her Make her pretend  That she wants you to know how she feels And in the end All of her pain I can steal",

There are all these big tall trees  And call me crazy  But I don't think I could live in a tree  For very long  I hop in his Saturn, like the car  Not like Venus And we cross into the trees  Who-o-o-o-o-oa  And we meet at Rulli's  I get a pastry or two  And I smile for both of you  I get a bottle of the fizzy drink  That tastes like orange  Not like Sunkist  But the orange taste like adults would like  And I feel so free  There's no way to see through me  And I'm even smiling  When Mom finally leaves  I can't climb those stairs on my own  On my own",

So I take an hour or two, find the best way to impress you Press the putty down a bit, and the image peels with it I got a lot of problems There might just be something wrong with me But luckily, I will show you everything I can pretend to be I got a lot of problems The nice thing about lying to others and yourself Is that eventually you can stop sweating the details And you act so indignant every time they find A single little piece of you poking out from behind I got a lot of problems But isn't it endearing?",

All the people in this city Feel like shadows I am never leaving this bed No no no no no no no no no Your gravestone sits on your old front lawn You're too tired to talk, and too tired to yawn This is your problem Blink real fast, tell yourself it's true This hotel room feels more like home than you ever do And there's no garbage disposal No one told me I was wrong Why did no one tell me I was wrong? All the people in this city Feel like shadows I am never leaving this bed No no no no no no no no no The bathroom mirror's bleeding The refrigerator's leaking The whole place is blinking twelve The nights are long and the days are longer You think by next month you'll feel stronger Here's a toast to you  No one told me I was wrong Why did no one tell me I was wrong? All the people in this city Feel like shadows I am never leaving this bed No no no no no no no no no",

All I want is for you not to hate me Do you hate me? Will that break me? Why should you like me? I don't like me I can't stand me So why should you have to  Why am I still singing when I've got nothing to sing about? Another lie on the pile So toward the darkness I still shout What do you think?

I've got better things to do than to argue with you like a child who's been told something untrue you've poisoned what you grew in the dark get a light, get a light, get a light get away from me test my blood if you want but give it back to me give it back to me give all the blood you take back to me",
