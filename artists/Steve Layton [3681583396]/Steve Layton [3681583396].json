So many things from unimaginable places came together to create me (and you), and when I die (as will you) that vortex evaporates and returns all the parts of \"me\" back to the Universe. But while I'm here, this vortex will spin sound and music from the threads of many, many other vortexes that have inhabited, or perhaps still inhabit, this world. And on we go... Pieces created from January 28th to February 18th, 2024.",

            "about": "A compilation of mash-ups/mixes created from 2010 through 2025, by Steve Layton from tracks contributed to the weekly worldwide online event known as Sound-In. These are tracks that, for whatever reason or other, weren't included on albums at the time. Most have never been heard since their weekend of creation.\nSince early 2009, various musicians around the world have checked in weekly at a web site first known as \"ImprovFriday\", and later \"Sound-In\". From Thursday afternoon (US Pacific time) through Saturday evening, any and all are free to share newly composed or improvised tracks, hear each other’s work, discuss and connect.\nPart of my own working style these past 30 years is the mash-up, remix, or audio collage. Never being much of a live performer, averse to microphones and limited in the equipment I could call my “studio,” I’ve often resorted to integrating (or sometimes, dissembling) others’ recorded music and sound into newly composed pieces of my own.\nImprovisation is often performed solo, but just as often as a group venture. At Sound-In we had many great solo tracks being offered up; yet many times I’d be struck by how sympathetic this artist’s track was with another’s, and would imagine how wonderful if the distance between us became immaterial and these two, three or four could be playing in the same space and time. And well, given that we were dealing with recordings, why not? By using my own expertise and ear I could bring the individual tracks together, bring people into the same “room” as it were, and create wholly new and convincing works in the process.\nFew of these tracks were altered in any drastic way, which is why I don‘t think of them as “remixes;” rather, most of the tracks heard here are left largely intact, simply laid over and against one another, with just some fades and general spatial processing applied. To me the process is much closer to ikebana -- the Japanese art of flower-arranging. There’s an abstract element of storytelling at work, too, though the specific story told by the title came only after the piece was finished.",

            "about": "Steve Layton (Seattle, USA):\nOn the morning of the 2nd of July 2019 I woke up to a message from my long-time, long-distance artist/musician friend Jude Cowan Montague  (www.judecowanmontague.com).  We've collaborated on a couple different albums over the years; this time out she wrote: \"I'd like to do a new work together and a piece about our album we did together and do an article about us working together - Steve. What do you think?\"... Well, I thought send them right along!\nIn short order, Jude sent along one long track containing five short instrumentals featuring the bare bones of a melody played on Minimoog (Welsh Minimoog, 1990s Alex Winter, 1 of 5/6 in the world) and a bassy/drummy pattern played on a Novation Circuit Groovebox.\nI pulled those into Propellerheads Reason and starting with the first \"song\", both treated Jude's original sounds with some effects, and used various tools in Reason to derive new tracks from the original audio, which could then be given to completely different Reason instruments. I worked on each of Jude's originals in sequence, so there's kind of a progressive build-up in the way they are augmented and embellished.\nForty-eight hours later I finished the last of the five tracks. Both Jude and myself are happy with the still-spontaneous quality of the new mixes, rough and ready but immediate and fresh.\nJude Cowan Montague (London, England):\nI was in a bad mood, I had wanted to play music all day but something kept getting in the way. Then a friend came round with some guitars for Matt to fix (my other half in Montague Armstrong). Then I decided to just get my head down and record some tracks for Steve like I'd promised. As I played I got in the zone and my bad mood went away. I thought of our previous album we had made and tried to get some continuity in my imagination. I love what Steve did with the tracks I sent him.",

            "about": "2010 found me heavily involved with a worldwide music sharing and improvisation network (ImprovFriday), as well as a gradual instrumental shift towards small analog synth performance coupled with Propellerheads’ Reason virtual synthesis environment. Much of the work here consists of solo improvisations based on “riding” one, two or three synths much like one rides a bull; to try and stay on top of the patches, letting their own tendencies guide my actions , and the music that results. This collection could be considered a “sketchbook” of sorts, or perhaps a kind of panorama of the year’s explorations.\n-- Steve Layton, Pompano Beach FL, Dec 2010",

            "about": "On each of my albums I'm a wildly eclectic musician, swerving stylistically across the spectrum. I tend to group tracks chronologically, just as they come out of my head. But I thought for once I might gather up some tracks that are more explicitly pop and dance oriented, just to give someone an easier entry into my work. Though \"easier\" is a relative term; I use the conventions of pop and dance, can't help but subvert them to some degree. After all, the real pop and dance musicians are already making perfectly good stuff that rides right down the rail, so why do that when I can de-rail the machine a little? So dance or sing, in this alternate world that could be. :-)",

In Zoroastrian tradition, these are the first six \"sparks\" or emanations of the noncreated Creator, through whom all subsequent creation was accomplished.\nAsha, \"Truth/Righteousness\"\nManah, \"Purpose\"\nKshatra Vairya, \"Desirable Dominion\"\nHaurvatat, \"Wholeness\"\nSpenta Armaiti, \"Holy Devotion\"\nAmeretat, \"Immortality\"\nThese tracks are all long drone-based works, all on the same single pitch, with each created from the material of the one before. That strong unity reflects these six mythic beings own common origin and bond, while the progressive variation of the original template gives each its own personality.",

            "about": "Early in 2009, Seattle composer J.C. Combs started a loose weekly online sharing of people's playing. Called \"ImprovFriday\", for the original time frame (since expanded to two days, and defined by each participant's time zone), it provides a simple way for musicians to post improvisations and other work, freshly made, share, comment on, and even remake each others' efforts.\nBenjamin Smith, an improvising musician from West Orange, New Jersey, was on of the early few to sign on; it didn't take long everyone to be impressed with his musical sensibility. Smith ventures far beyond the standard idea of jazz improvisation, into a sound world equally influenced by modern classical, ambient and ritual. All of the pieces are free improvisations on this CD invented at the time of recording, and feature Smith alone at a Yamaha P-70 digital keyboard.\nI'm proud to offer this collection of improvs Ben made these past few months for our \"ImprovFriday\" sessions. Together they show a whole range of exploration, and a kind of absolutely clear honesty in their conception, execution and recording.\n-- Steve Layton\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI am a music feeler and improviser interested in spreading the learning and practice of music improvisation (not only jazz) in the world. In 2006 I decided to awaken my musicianship and find an organization that shares and promotes improvisation in music for anyone interested, so I joined David Darling's Music for People -- a nontechnical, non-genre community -- and am a Mentor in the leadership program. I am interested in expanding and facilitating improvisation, collaborating with others who passionately share what they do in art, health, or any field that promotes healthy collaboration in a community.\nInfluences:\nThe sounds of the universe. The feelings, colors, nuances, and scents of the sounds of the universe. Those that are brave enough to be themselves at an early age. Memorable movies and all involved in making them so. Poetry, just a few names are Pablo Neruda, Rumi, Robert Hughes, Maya Angelou. The speech and meaning of people like Martin Luther King, T. N. Hahn, Gandhi, so many others. Music of artist who show vulnerabilities, like Ludwig Van Beethoven, Tom Waits, Cat Stevens, Miles Davis, Alfred Schnittke, Kryzstof Penderecki, Dimitri Shotstakovich, Jimmie Scott, Milton Nascimento, so many others. Calypso, the Mighty Sparrow, J.S. Bach, lyrics and music of Jim Croce and Don McClean, Roberta Flack, Aretha Franklin, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald. Lori Cotler, Glenn Velez. So many musicians I've not listed. David Darling, Julie Weber, Mary Kynsh, Jim Oshinsky, Lynn and Eric Miller, Christopher Anderson-Bazzoli, Michael DeMaria of Music for People. Arthur Hull, Baba Olatunji. Kora (African string instrument).\nThe human voice. Mountains and areas that overlook landscapes.\nSelflessness. Trains. Places. Not knowing. Time unnoticed. Love.\n-- Benjamin Smith",

            "about": "These four tracks were all made over the course of a few days in February 2020. ...Though that's a bit disingenuous, since their source material is over 20 years old. I had the idea to take MIDI files of some of my older, normal-length, long-finished pieces, stretch all the note events out to many times their original length, and replace all the original sound/instrument patches with completely different ones in Reason. Of course this changes almost everything about the piece; what were once single lines or simple sounds became complex, evolving sounds, lines that were sustained suddenly become arpeggiated, formerly musical lines get replaced with purely electronic or sound-effect type patches... The challenge was to make it all hang together in just as convincing a way as they did back when I created the first versions of each. The process seemed to turn each new version into a kind of evocative \"soundtrack\". For what film or action, I'll leave it up to each listener's mind to come up with. They're definitely pieces that demand you get lost, give yourself up to the flow.",

All of the tracks created by these musicians are mostly improvisations, and none of the musicians were aware of what the others were creating. From this unpredictable pool, Steve Layton chose certain tracks to lay down against certain others, added some judicious editing/processing, and a new hybrid recording was born.",

Each week, no one tells each musician what to play, no one tells the mashers or remixers which tracks to use, we don't even know if or when any particular musician will show up for the event... Yet somehow they do, and a certain magic happens, thoughts and lines coalesce into new pieces; the sound of everyone, even though separated by hundreds or thousands of miles, somehow playing together. These dozen tracks document but a small part of the magic that happens each week at Sound-In.",

            "about": "A wide-ranging collection of tracks from the last few years (a few tracks originally were written in the late '90s and early '00s, but all are newer updated versions), with an emphasis on music with a beat. But most of these \"beats \" aren't often what most people think of when they hear that word... Interspersed are more ambient tracks, some relatively peaceful, some relatively inscrutable, and some relatively terrifying. The shifts in tone, energy, texture and emotion, can all be dizzying. But the one thing constant through all is the sheer ecstasy I feel conjuring and spinning out worlds of music from nothing.\nWith the exception of Henry Mancini's \"Peter Gunn\" theme in the last two tracks, and some collaborative material with my good musician friend Marco Lucchi on \"Semde, Longde, Mennagde\", everything on this CD was written, played and produced by me, using a single Roland A-500 Pro keyboard, Propellerheads Reason, and Adobe Audition.\nOpen your ears, suspend your expectations, and take one wild ride.\n-- Steve Layton",

But then sometimes there's a sudden creative burst, just popping out of seemingly nowhere. I'll take it... The tracks on this new album were made in the space of a mere 13 days (!!).\nMusic shares something with dreams, unfolding as much in the mind as in the ear. Like dreams, that unfolding makes its own reality, untethered the regular, concrete physical world. For the length of the piece, we're taken *out*, somewhere with its own time, place, and rules.\nI don't know what's going to happen when I sit down to create a piece. What happens surprises me just as much as (I hope) it will you.\nTake 45 minutes to visit these dreams that came to me, and can now come to you.",

            "about": "The official short biography of San Franciscan improviser Gino Robair  www.ginorobair.com)  reads: \"Gino Robair has performed and recorded with Tom Waits, Anthony Braxton, John Zorn, Nina Hagen, Terry Riley, Lou Harrison, John Butcher, Derek Bailey, Peter Kowald, Otomo Yoshihide, and the ROVA Saxophone Quartet. He is one of the '25 innovative percussionists' included in the book Percussion Profiles (SoundWorld, 2001), as well as a founding member of the Splatter Trio and Pink Mountain. His opera, I, Norton, based on the life of Norton I, Emperor of the United States, has been performed throughout North America and Europe.\"\nGino also happens to be a friend of mine, and a generous soul. One of the signs of that generosity was an album Gino recorded back in 1995-97, titled \"Singular Pleasures: Music for Listening and Sampling\". A veritable compendium of Gino's drumming and percussive play, it was meant not only for listening but also to be sampled and remixed by anyone who might wish to.\nRecently re-released on Bandcamp  (ginorobair.bandcamp.com/album/singular-pleasures-music-for-listening-and-sampling),  I thought I'd celebrate by making a few remixes of the album's tracks. In keeping with my own style, each track was kept mostly intact, simply chosen and layered against one another in a careful arrangement I liken to Japanese \"ikebana\" (flower arranging). Certain of the original tracks were run through one or two effects units in Propellerheads Reason software, and there is one very simple original track of mine contributed to the last remix. Otherwise, all of the sounds come from Gino's playing.\nIn the spirit of improvisation and spontaneity, the three remixes were all created on the same day, and each remix in less than an hour.",

Here are a few.\nI used to always think of albums by length. A good album should at the very least clock in at around 35-40 minutes. But lately I've been feeling differently. I create various and varied pieces, as always, but then I feel a kind of arc in their flow. Then along comes a track that, unbidden, says \"This is it. This is the closure.\" That may still be 40, 50, or 60 minutes, but—like this new album—maybe it ends at only 25 minutes. And you know what? That's okay.",

Blame it on my move in September 2013 from Dallas to Seattle, or something... While listening back to the tracks I thought of a number of tweaks and revisions I might try, so four or five have some significant alterations from their original forms.",

A yellowed play-bill in old-fashioned lettering announced that the SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD IN THREE LIFELIKE DIMENSIONS awaited one inside and I bent my head and stepped into the warm, dim cave...\nThe machines were of ancient rusted cast iron decorated with impressions of cupids, eagles and knots of ribbons. Each was the size and shape of an old-fashioned oven and, at the front, a pair of glass eye-pieces jutted out on long, hollow stalks. I examined all the exhibits in turn. Inside each one, underneath the item it represented, was a sign, clumsily lettered by hand, giving a title...\"\n-- Angela Carter, \"The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman\"",

This anatomical section, composed of pinkish wax dimpled at the knee, did not admit the possibility of the existence of a torso. A bristling pubic growth rose to form a kind of coat of arms above the circular proscenium it contained at either side... The dark red and purple crenelations surrounding the vagina acted as a frame for a perfectly round hole through which the viewer glimpsed the moist, luxuriant landscape of the interior. Here endlessly receded before one’s eyes a miniature but irresistible vista of semi-tropical forest where amazing fruits hung on the trees, while from the dappled and variegated chalices of enormous flowers the size of millstones, perfumes of such extraordinary potency that they had become visible to the eye exuded as soft, purple dew. ...It seemed that winter and rough winds would never touch these bright, oblivious regions or ripple the surface of the lucid river which wound a tranquil course down the central valley. The eye of the beholder followed the course of this river upwards towards the source, and so it saw, for the first time, after some moments of delighted looking, the misty battlements of a castle. The longer one looked at the dim outlines of this castle, the more sinister it grew, as though its granite viscera housed as many torture chambers as the Château of Silling.\"",

Each eye was a full three feet from end to end, complete with a lid and a tear duct, and was suspended in the air without any visible support. Like the pubic hair in the previous model, the lashes had been scrupulously set one by one in narrow hems of rosy wax but this time the craftsmen had achieved a disturbing degree of life-likeness which uncannily added to the synthetic quality of the image. The rounded whites were delicately veined with crimson to produce an effect like that of the extremely precious marble used in Italy during the late baroque period to make altars for the chapels of potentates and the irises were simple rings of deep brown bottle glass while in the pupils I could see, reflected in two discs of mirror, my own eyes, very greatly magnified by the lenses of the machine. Since my own pupils, in turn, reflected the false eyes before me while these reflections again reflected those reflections, I soon realized I was watching a model of eternal regression.\"",

The right breast had been partially segmented and hung open to reveal two surfaces of meat as bright and false as the plaster sirloins which hang in toy butcher’s shops while her belly was covered with some kind of paint that always contrived to look wet and, from the paint, emerged the handle of an enormous knife which was kept always a-quiver by the action (probably) of a spring.\"",

The wrinkled foreskin was drawn far enough back to uncover in its importunate entirety the grossly swollen, sunset-coloured tip as far as a portion of the shaft itself and, at the minute cranny in the centre, where a wick must have been lodged, burned a small, pure flame. As the viewer watched, the candle tipped forward on its balls and pointed towards one accusingly.\"",

The figures, again exquisitely executed in wax, looked as though they might have been modelled in one piece and, due to a clockwork mechanism hidden in their couch, they rocked continually back and forth. This coupling had a fated, inevitable quality. One could not picture a cataclysm sufficiently violent to rend the twined forms asunder and neither could one conceive of a past beginning for they were so firmly joined together it seemed they must have been formed in this way at the beginning of time and, locked parallel, would go on thus for ever to infinity. They were not so much erotic as pathetic, poor palmers of desire who never budged as much as an inch on their endless pilgrimage. The man’s face was moulded into the woman’s neck and so could not be seen but the head of the woman was constructed so as to oscillate in the socket of her neck and, as it rolled from side to side, her face was intermittently visible.\"",

                    "about": "I awoke and yet I knew I was still sleeping for my bed was now, in fact, an island in the middle of an immense lake. Night was approaching although I knew it was nearly dawn for outside – outside, that is, of the dream – a cock continued to crow. However, within my dream, the shadows of evening took the colours from the shifting waters round me and a small wind rustled the quills of the pine trees, for my island was covered with pines. Nothing moved except this little, lonely wind. I waited, for the dream imperiously demanded that I wait and I seemed to wait endlessly. I do not think I have ever felt so alone, as if I were the last living thing left in the world and this island and this lake were all that was left of the world. Presently I saw the object of my vigil. A creature was approaching over the water but it did not assuage my loneliness for though I could see it was alive, it did not seem to be alive in the same sense that I was alive and I shuddered with dread. I know I must have stood in an attitude of awed listening, as if to hear the scratching of the claws of the unknown on the outside rind of the world. The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown; I was afraid. I had been afraid when I was a child, when I would lie awake at night and hear my mother panting and grunting like a tiger in the darkness beyond the curtain and I thought she had changed into a beast. Now I was even more afraid than I had been then. As it drew near, I saw it was a swan. It was a black swan. I cannot tell you how ugly it was; nor yet how marvellous it was. Its vapid eyes were set too close together on its head and expressed a kind of mindless evil that was quite without glamour, though evil is usually attractive, because evil is defiant. Its elongated neck had none of the grace traditionally ascribed to the necks of swans but lolled foolishly, now this way, now that, like a length of hose. And the beak, which was the clear, pinkish scarlet of scentless roses, striped with a single band of white, was flat, broad and spatulate, fit only for grubbing worms from mud. It swam remorselessly and terribly towards me but, when only a few yards of shifting water lay between us, it paused to unfurl its enormous wings as if it were opening a heraldic umbrella. Never have I seen such blackness, such a soft, feathered, absolute black, a black as intense as the negation of light, black the colour of the extinction of consciousness. The swan flexed its neck like a snake about to strike, opened its beak and began to sing so that I knew it was about to die and I knew, too, she was a swan and also a woman for there issued from her throat a thrilling, erotic contralto. Her song was a savage, wordless lament with the dramatic cadences of flamenco in a scale the notes of which were unfamiliar to me yet seemed those of an ultimate Platonic mode, an elemental music. The shadows deepened yet one last ray of the invisible sun drew a gleam from a golden collar around her throbbing throat and on the collar was engraved the single word: ALBERTINA. The dream broke like a storm and I woke.\nAngela Carter, \"The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman\"",

                    "about": "The heavy, mahogany door of our common bedroom was guarded on either side by jasper colossi, Babylonian monsters with curved, brooding beaks and feathered arms that brushed the faces of those who went inside with a menacing voluptuous caress. ‘We call this room the Sphere of Spheres,’ she said. She ushered us into a circular chamber filled with a shifting medley of colours from a lamp with a stained glass shade that turned in a slow circle in the middle of the ceiling. The Count carried his victim to the bed as ceremoniously as if it were a sacrificial altar but I did not bother to watch him or even to look more closely at this place of consummated desires for the Madame had turned towards me and placed her finger on her incomparable lips. I remembered that mouth and that gesture perfectly. I gasped. I think I sobbed. She plucked away my mask and kissed me lightly on the lips. I saw her eyes through the clefts of her sheath of black leather; their incalculable depths were blurred with tears. ‘I am Albertina,’ she said. She pulled off her head covering and her black hair fell down around her well-remembered face. I do not know why she loved me at first sight, as I loved her, even though I first saw her in a dream. Yet we pursued one another across the barriers of time and space; we dared every vicissitude of fortune for a single kiss before we were torn apart again and we saw the events of the war in which we were enlisted on opposite sides only by the light of one another’s faces. I took her in my arms. We were exactly the same height and the arches of whore did not interrupt our first embrace. The earth turned on the pivot of her mouth. The sense of seraphic immanence which had afflicted me in the city was now fulfilled. Her arms clasped my neck and her belly pressed against my nakedness as if striving to transcend the mortal flaw that divided us and so effect a total, visceral mingling, binding us forever, so that the same blood would flow within us both and our nerves would knit and our skins melt and fuse in the force of the electricity we generated between us. We moved towards the round bed that spun round like the world on an axis in the middle of the room. Here the Count crouched slavering over the ruins of his unfortunate prostitute who was now only a bleeding moan. We glanced at them with the indifference natural to lovers and I turned back the coverlet of dark fur to lay my Albertina down on sheets that bore stains as tragic and mysterious as those on a pavement after a nude had been thrown down from a balcony. I knelt above her and kissed her cool breasts. I sucked great mouthfuls of the cold water of her breasts, as though my thirst would never be slaked. The eyes on her single garment closed one by one.\nAngela Carter, \"The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman\"",

All of the tracks created by these musicians are mostly improvisations, and none of the musicians were aware of what the others were creating. From this unpredictable pool, Steve Layton chose certain tracks to lay down against certain others, and a new hybrid recording was born.",

            "about": "In early 2019 composer Jennifer Jolley  (www.jenniferjolley.com)  came into possession of a Moffenzeef Stargazer modular drone synthesizer. As part of her practice and learning, Jennifer began making and sharing a series of morning \"jamm-z\", recording live improvs with a patch and its tweaks. Her composer friend Steve Layton was smitten by these rough and ready improvs, but thought it might be fun to make slightly more elaborate pieces out of the original source recordings. The first worked so well that Steve was encouraged to continue, finding ways to transform and amplify while still keeping their roots firmly in Jennifer's original improvs. This album collects the results, interleaving Jennifer's originals with Steve's remixes.\nThat's the official explanation, anyway. The unofficial is WE'RE HAVING HELLA FUN. CONSIDER YOURSELF JAMM-D.",
            "credits": "released May 21, 2019\nAll Jennifer Jolley tracks are improvisations using the Moffenzeef Stargazer drone synthesizer.\nAll Steve Layton tracks built solely from Jennifer Jolley's improvisations, manipulated in Propellerheads Reason.",

            "about": "I first encountered the music of Steve Moshier (d.2016) over ten years ago, when tracks from an obscure album by the Cartesian Reunion Memorial Orchestra appeared online.\n(The CRMO was a group of southern California composers and performers, who had mostly all studied at university together in the 1970s, then banded together in the 1980s to create an ensemble to play and promote their own music in venues around Los Angeles. As part of that group, Steve both composed a number of their pieces, and performed on mallet percussion.)\nI shared the link to this rather unusual and historic music in a post at the music website Sequenza21, and shortly after attracted a comment from a couple of the original CRMO members -- one of which was Steve Moshier. So, contact made...\nAround the same time, another musician friend had created a small social website (NetNewMusic) for new-music composers, performers, and fans, to get together and share thoughts, ideas, and works. Before too long, Steve showed up there and became very engaged with the site and people. One of the things that was born on the NNM website, around 2009, was a weekly event first known as ImprovFriday. During the space of two days each week, musicians from around the USA and even other countries would create and share improvisations, sound art -- any freshly made music, really. Steve participated in this from the first, usually making very evocative, short, electronic pieces using software like Propellerheads Reason. He continued as a regular contributor right up until the day this June, when he was found unconscious at home and died a couple days later in the hospital.\nSteve was an extremely energetic, prolific, and giving musician, with our own ImprovFriday (now Sound-In) group, and with his many students at Rio Hondo College in California, and his sudden death was a blow to all of us in his circle of friends. As musicians, a number of us have paid tribute to Steve with music, simply because that's what we think in. As part of that tribute in the week after his death, I had the idea to take many of the short electronic tracks that Steve had contributed over the years to ImprovFriday/Sound-In, and stitch them together into larger forms.\nThe four tracks here use some 30+ tracks made by Steve, laid end-to-end and on top of each other, to create longer journeys and stories. Steve's electronic tracks were always very visual, cinematic even (thus my use of the word \"Kino\" [cinema] in the album title). I'd like to think that these mash-up tracks retain all of that, while allowing the listener to more fully sample Steve's restless creativity. I made a point in these mash-ups, of not using any extra audio processing; everything heard was conceived, performed and recorded by Steve himself.",

            "about": "I was approached for a piece remembering the events of 9-11 in New York City. I chose to combine four tracks created during our 2010 ImprovFriday sessions, where musicians around the world meet each week to share their creativity.\n1. Storm Warning 3:42\n2. In the Sky 5:11\n3. The Heavy Air 4:45\n4. Still in the Night You Come 7:55\nNothing literal, only four evocations of different \"atmospheres\" that surround and inhabit memory. Events such as this carry a bit of everything for people; unease, awe, terror, desolation, but also survival, courage, tenderness, remembrance, and the thread of life that will always continue. None of these can really ever be extricated from any other part, and so it is here.",

            "about": "A collection of improvisational tracks made in the last few years, that purposely limited the musical material I was working with. The pieces use anywhere from one to five notes, that never change through the course of the track. The challenge is to use all the other parameters at hand, to create something that hangs together as a fully-realized piece of music. As improvisations, they're also living snapshots of small moments of my mind and hands at the keyboard.",
            "credits": "released May 6, 2014\nAll tracks were composed, performed, recorded by Steve Layton, using Propellerheads Reason and Adobe Audition, in Dallas TX and Seattle WA, 2011-2014.",

Even then, the original WAVE file would simply be too big, so the original is uploaded here in a 16-bit FLAC lossless format.\nThe Main universe of this mandala is a thick electroacoustic river, that slowly but continuously shifts to different harmonic realms. These are triggered, signaled, and guided by the actual sounds of Tibetan Buddhist horns, reeds, cymbals, and chanting.",

            "about": "Sound-In (known at first as ImprovFriday) began in 2010 as simply a weekly online gathering-place for musicians of every stripe to share recordings of their improvisations and compositions, usually stuff a bit outside the standard pop/rock/jazz boundaries.\nVery early on, I began taking the recordings that appeared during these 48-hour \"events\", and laying them down together in a multitrack DAW. Sometimes I manipulated a track with various effects, but most often letting them simply play out on their own against one or more of the other musicians' tracks. Each musician's track was usually made with no knowledge or regard of what any of the others were making and offering, yet somehow the mere act of bringing them into the same \"space\" led to surprisingly coherent mixes. Creating intention from non-intention became the name of my game.\nBeginning in March 2011 I began collecting these mash-up/mixes into albums, so they could be preserved and disseminated. It's now April 2022, and so far there are 45 such albums, with 606 tracks total.\nBut those 600+ tracks are by no means all there is. In fact, there are many, many more tracks that weren't collected at the time they were made. Not for any lesser quality, but rather simply that they didn't fit the flow of the album in that moment.\nAnd so this 46th collection of 39 previously uncollected mash-ups, spanning the years from 2010 all the way to 2018.\nI may be responsible for the end result of each mash/mix, but none of them would be possible without a myriad of creative musicians from across the continent and across the oceans, that week after week came by our site to share their playing, and share in the communal listening. Some flitted through for only one or two weeks, some have been contributing from the very first. But each played a vital part, added their own surprising, vital color and energy. I considering each of these musicians a friend, and I'm endlessly grateful for their giving me the opportunity to weave my own dreams out of theirs.",

            "about": "1997 was the year of my first computer (Windows '95), and the big shift from composing and recording only with external hardware. All the composition and recording could now take place in the computer (though for a long while all of my actual sounds came from still driving my Alesis QSR rack-mount synth; it just had hundreds great sounds/instruments and great multichannel MIDI capability).\nIt was the second momentous change in my music, after getting MIDI and multichannel cassette recording in 1987, and my new normal way of working until I brought everything onto the computer with Reason in 2007.\nThese tracks were composed, performed, and recorded in the computer, creating all the parts with Voyetra's Digital Orchestrator Pro playing the QSR, which sent its audio back into the computer to be recorded with first Goldwave, then later with Cool Edit (which was later acquired by Adobe to become Audition). The computer was a standard generic of the time, with a basic hard drive, RAM, processor, and reliable but somewhat noisy soundcard. This means the original recordings were by no means studio-quality. Yet, they ARE absolutely authentic, and capture the fire, enthusiasm, and wonder of exploring this new way of working.\nA lot of the works I made during that time were more in the Classical vein, and are represented on other albums here. These pieces lean more toward the \"pop\" and ambient side of things. People who know me and my music know that I've always been restlessly eclectic, zig-zagging between genres and styles at will. That's what you get here, in spades.",

            "about": "Night Light. Only three elements -- perhaps two actors and a chorus? (Every person will likely hear it differently.) The story only makes sense to them; I brought them together, but they decided how it would all unfold. The piece is quiet, which is what you'll need for listening.\nThe three elements are derived from three pieces by Walter Marchetti (who died in 2015) -- “Le Secche Del Delirio”, \"Perpetuum Mobile\", and \"La Caccia\". You'd be hard-pressed to hear any direct reference to the pieces in this track, but they determine everything that goes on in their particular thread of the whole. They're kind of like skeletons that I hang a new skin on.\nIn the dead-empty street I sense signals\nfrom a place I've never been\nto a place I'll never be.\nUnspool the film.",

            "about": "These are all tracks created between the middle of April and the middle of July, 2020. It's more than understandable that between sheltering from a deadly virus, fighting racial inequities, and watching a government in meltdown, some folk might find little motivation to create new work.\nBut my own path, for decades now, has been to simply create, day after day, week after week. Sometimes there are reflections of current events, but often it's just a matter of opening a blank canvas and following what arises. In the midst of times both good and bad, there's something centering, positive, and life-giving in the act of creation.\nThe events mentioned are still ongoing, so this is only the first part of a record of my own mind during these trials. I can't know what comes next, except to know that as long as I wake up in another morning, something else will come.\n-- Steve Layton, Seattle, July 2020",

Most of these were semi-improvised in very short spaces of time, using Propellerhead's Reason software and a modest Roland keyboard controller. They don't develop traditional song or dance forms so much as simply attempt to conjure, explore, and sustain some image or mood.",

            "about": "Jude Cowan Montague is an artist, historian and news archivist. She works on the Reuters collection at ITN Source. She is a poet and her debut collection, \"For the Messengers\" responded to Reuters news stories in 2008 that she archived as part of her day job.\n\"The News Agents\" is a weekly radio program curated and hosted by Jude and Rob Edwards, on Resonance FM  (www.resonancefm.com)  in London. \"Where news meets arts,\" the program intersperses interviews on various topical and social issues, with creative works that play off the programs topics.\nAs part of this mix, Jude wrote and read a number of poems, that she asked Steve Layton to set to music. Sometimes the voice is nearly pure, sometimes treated in various ways. The music itself is deliberately simple to keep the focus on voice and poem, but each has a different aural quality, set in its own sound-space.",

            "about": "Between April 26th-28th 2012, twenty-five musicians from around the U.S. and the world gathered at the music-sharing website known as  ImprovFriday.com.  The suggested theme for our sharing was simply \"ppp;\" i.e., the music term for \"extremely soft and quiet.\" How each person interpreted this in their own performance was left to them. This CD documents mash-ups I made during the course of the weekend event, of all the different tracks coming in to the site from these musicians. Some tracks were heavily edited, but most were left close to their original state, and simply allowed to interact with the other tracks in an unforced way.\nMusicians: Günter Gläser, Kawol Samarkand, Roger Sundström, Peter Thörn, Glenn Smith, J.C. Combs, Lee Noyes, Kavin Allenson, Steve Moyes, Richard Sanderson, Paul Muller, Lydia Busler-Blais, Benjamin Smith, Jérôme Poirier, Fabio Keiner, Norbert Oldani, Chris Vaisvil, Steve Layton, Paulo Chagas, Steve Moshier, Bruce Hamilton, Shane Cadman, Jim Goodin.",

            "about": "Strange times we live in... A collection of tracks composed in early March, 2025.\nIn the Mongolian folk tale \"The Golden Horse\", J̌ulan-gerel is a young woman warrior with magic powers, a disciple of a hermit master who lives on Reclining Lion Mountain. She rides a magic eight-branched stag, and her weapon is a huge precious sword.\nThe Chinese ruan is a 4-stringed round lute, played since at least the 8th century.\nThe Golden Light Mantra or Sutra is an important chant in Daoist practice. It is about protection; a charging of positive protective energy. This chanting is from Daoist teacher Ji Sifu, of the Sān Luō Dào, while the music is mine. In Sān Luō Dào the main elements are the Sky and the Earth, and the connecting bridge between them. Ji Sifu chants in something he calls sān luō huà, a dialect that he writes \"sounds a bit like Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, Cantonese, and many other dialects, but is none of them.\"",

The right hand is closed around the sword finger. Draw the golden light charm in the void with the sword finger every day.\"",

            "about": "When in 2010 we began the weekly online improvisational music-sharing event known as ImprovFriday (by late 2012 renamed Sound-In), one of the founding members was a guitarist living in Ocala, Florida, by the name of Jeff Duke. Coming from a psych-rock background but with an experimental bent, Jeff was master at building ambient, looping guitar textures, often with soaring solos embedded in the mix. He was also an early adopter of live-streaming, and an enthusiastic collaborator with other online musicians across the country and across the oceans.\nFrom 2010 through 2013 Jeff was a constant presence and inspiration in our ImprovFriday / Sound-In events, and it was my honor to be able to mash/mix so many of his tracks with the contributions of our other members.\nAround the end of 2013, Jeff's health issues and a general dissatisfaction led to him stopping most playing, yet we stayed in touch as he rode out the Florida storms over the years.\nIn May of 2020, cancer claimed Jeff before we could give much of a proper goodbye.\nThis album is dedicated to his memory, and features ImprovFriday / Sound-In mash-ups I made during 2010-2013, all featuring Jeff's own playing interwoven with the other musicians that had dropped in that week.\nMaking mash-up mixes is a bit like cooking; the overall \"flavor\" of a mashup is heavily influenced by the particular sound of the musicians that went into it. And so it is with these tracks; including Jeff's guitar work just about guaranteed that the vibe would take on a spacious, psychedelic, sailing or soaring ambiance.\nThanks and rest in peace, Jeff, our warm friend and a great musician.\nJeff Duke's own music can be found at his Bandcamp web page:  jeffduke.bandcamp.com\nJeff's collaborations with the Italian guitarist Gaetano Fontanazza as UsIt can also be found on Bandcamp:  usit.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "A compilation of mash-ups/mixes created from 2013 through 2017, by Steve Layton from tracks contributed to the weekly worldwide online event known as Sound-In. These are tracks that, for whatever reason or other, weren't included on albums at the time. Most have never been heard since their weekend of creation.\nSince early 2009, various musicians around the world have checked in weekly at a web site first known as \"ImprovFriday\", and later \"Sound-In\". From Thursday afternoon (US Pacific time) through Saturday evening, any and all are free to share newly composed or improvised tracks, hear each other’s work, discuss and connect.\nPart of my own working style these past 30 years is the mash-up, remix, or audio collage. Never being much of a live performer, averse to microphones and limited in the equipment I could call my “studio,” I’ve often resorted to integrating (or sometimes, dissembling) others’ recorded music and sound into newly composed pieces of my own.\nImprovisation is often performed solo, but just as often as a group venture. At Sound-In we had many great solo tracks being offered up; yet many times I’d be struck by how sympathetic this artist’s track was with another’s, and would imagine how wonderful if the distance between us became immaterial and these two, three or four could be playing in the same space and time. And well, given that we were dealing with recordings, why not? By using my own expertise and ear I could bring the individual tracks together, bring people into the same “room” as it were, and create wholly new and convincing works in the process.\nFew of these tracks were altered in any drastic way, which is why I don‘t think of them as “remixes;” rather, most of the tracks heard here are left largely intact, simply laid over and against one another, with just some fades and general spatial processing applied. To me the process is much closer to ikebana -- the Japanese art of flower-arranging. There’s an abstract element of storytelling at work, too, though the specific story told by the title came only after the piece was finished.",

            "about": "Roses Sabra (Sabra Letic) was born and grew up in Bosnia. In the 1990s she left for Germany and has lived there since. From an early age she has had a passion for acting and singing. Though not a \"professional\", Sabra has found an outlet through the sound-sharing website  Freesound.org   (freesound.org/people/Roses1401/).  There, over the years she has recorded all kinds of free-form monologues, vocalizations, and other snippets of voice, that anyone else is free to use in their own new creations.\nIn April 2018, paging through the Freesound website and looking for some new inspiration, I came across Sabra's tracks and was immediately struck by their unusual voice, unusual content, and unusual honesty. I set to work to gather a few of the tracks together into a piece, leaving them unedited as far as content and length, processing the voice in both simple and complex ways, and introducing just a bare minimum of a musical background. Sabra's long monologues define the length or \"boundaries\" of each piece, while other shorter recordings become words or vocalises that float in and out, or dot the sonic landscape. Each ends up telling a story, or maybe they are facets of the same story? -- \"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.\"",

            "about": "Mash-ups by Steve Layton, of tracks contributed by musicians worldwide during the weekly online event known as ImprovFriday  (www.improvfriday.com).  On this particular release, each track was personally chosen as a favorite by an ImprovFriday musician whose work appears on that track.\nVirtually all of the original tracks that make up the threads of these mash-ups were conceived and recorded with no knowledge of what the other musicians might be making and sharing. To keep the freshness and surprise, each mash-up was made using only the tracks shared during that particular two-day event. For the most part, very little processing (other than EQ, reverbs and fades) was used during the mash/mix procedure; the tracks are mostly just laid down next to each other and allowed to unfold and intertwine.\nFeatured musicians: Jérôme Poirier (France), Paul Hertz (Iowa), Benjamin Smith (New Jersey), Roger Sundström (Sweden), Peter Thörn (Sweden), Paul Muller (California), Kavin Allenson (Texas), Shane Cadman (California), Jeff Duke (Florida), Norbert Oldani (New York), Chris Vaisvil (Indiana), Jude Cowan (England), Steve Moyes (England), Diego Monroy (Spain), Jim Goodin (New York), Steve Moshier (California), Steve Layton (Texas), Bruce Hamilton (Washington), Richard Sanderson (England), Fabio Keiner (Austria), Gary Hall (Thailand).",

Some are memories of people already gone, yet some are the heightened experience of this moment, here and now, made vital by the knowledge of our temporary stay.\nAll tracks were created using reason 6.5 and Adobe Audition, with the exception of bird and insect samples in track 7 courtesy  Freesound.org.",

At Sound-In, musicians from all over the USA and around the world meet virtually to share new improvisations, compositions and sound-art.

            "about": "textbook: music of solitary landscapes in hyperspace (piece for IPS) (1984-1987)\nIPS is Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, the father of asepsis (along with Joseph Lister). I had gotten interested in his life and read parts of his textbook Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers while I was living in Chicago. The \"textbook\" part comes from the fact that each of the seven sections is named for a particular poem or book that I found interesting. While each \"text\" had something to do with each section, the work is not at all programmatic, and nothing should be read into the music based on what I chose for each section. -- David Toub",

            "about": "For over 20 years now, I've been creating, performing, and recording compositions for 'imaginary piano', and releasing them on a series of CDs subtitled The Composer Plays. The word 'play' is used in both senses; as the act of playing the piano, and the act of playing with the idea of the piano and piano performance. The pieces are for 'imaginary piano' because there is no actual, physical piano, and no actual physical hands playing. Of all of these pieces, on only two (Tripped Up and Taffeta Phantom) did I actually play any physical piano keyboard; the rest are all composed, interpreted, and recorded straight from a music-sequencing program 'piano roll', each note entered into the score with the click of a computer mouse.\nYet there's no machine-music here; each note was chosen, placed, and massaged by my own hands. Through all of these compositions, I 'play' with the idea of mixing the possible and the impossible in a natural and convincing way, with extra fingers or hands materializing and disappearing as the music demands. Even the sound of the piano changes from piece to piece, as I chose different virtual pianos to suit each performance. This album is a revisiting of a number of earlier pieces from 1998 through 2002, giving them new interpretations and new, higher-quality recordings. As well, there are a few newer pieces in the same vein, composed for this album in 2011-2013.",

Reason has many different piano types and sounds; rather than trying to minimize the differences, I've let each recording stand with the particular piano and recording quality I chose in that moment. Almost all of these pieces were made in the space of an hour or two, and are really just \"snapshots\" of some instant in time, my life, and my mind. -- Steve Layton, Seattle, 2017",

            "about": "A compilation of mash-ups / mixes created from early June to late September 2018, by Steve Layton from tracks contributed to the weekly worldwide online Sound-In event  (www.soundin.org).\nSince early 2009, various musicians around the world have checked in weekly at a web site first known as \"ImprovFriday\", and later \"Sound-In\". From Thursday afternoon (US Pacific time) through Saturday evening, any and all are free to share newly composed or improvised tracks, hear each other’s work, discuss and connect.\nPart of my own working style these past 30 years is the mash-up, remix, or audio collage. Never being much of a live performer, averse to microphones and limited in the equipment I could call my “studio,” I’ve often resorted to integrating (or sometimes, dissembling) others’ recorded music and sound into newly composed pieces of my own.\nImprovisation is often performed solo, but just as often as a group venture. At Sound-In we had many great solo tracks being offered up; yet many times I’d be struck by how sympathetic this artist’s track was with another’s, and would imagine how wonderful if the distance between us became immaterial and these two, three or four could be playing in the same space and time. And well, given that we were dealing with recordings, why not? By using my own expertise and ear I could bring the individual tracks together, bring people into the same “room” as it were, and create wholly new and convincing works in the process.\nFew of these tracks were altered in any drastic way, which is why I don‘t think of them as “remixes;” rather, most of the tracks heard here are left largely intact, simply laid over and against one another, with just some fades and general spatial processing applied. To me the process is much closer to ikebana -- the Japanese art of flower-arranging. There’s an abstract element of storytelling at work, too, though the specific story told by the title came only after the piece was finished.\nThe pieces in this compilation function as a documentary. They're presented in strict chronological order, just as each was made and offered up from day-to-day and week-to-week. Some Sound-In weekends have a general suggestive \"theme\" -- just a word or two -- and some of that can be heard as we listen to the tracks in order. It's a rather monstrous collection, clocking in at almost 3.5 hours, but full of variety and color. What's truly amazing is just how coherent these tracks, composed almost exclusively of chronologically and geographically unrelated solo improvisations, are. A lot of that is down to the endless creativity the participating musicians bring to each week's adventure. I admit to my own personality being strongly felt in each mash/mix. But I always try to preserve and show each of my fellow musician's voice in that mix as well.\n-- Steve Layton / Seattle / 1 October 2018",

After all that time there's still mess in the world, and magic in the music.\n\"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better. First the body. No. First the place. No. First both. Now either. Now the other. Sick of the either try the other. Sick of it back sick of the either. So on. Somehow on. Till sick of both. Throw up and go. Where neither. Till sick of there. Throw up and back. The body again. Where none. The place again. Where none. Try again. Fail again. Better again. Or better worse. Fail worse again. Still worse again. Till sick for good. Throw up for good. Go for good. Where neither for good. Good and all.”\n-- Samuel Beckett",

Though not afraid to use new technology in his music, when he picks up the guitar, oud, or fiddle, or maybe even sings a bit, what comes out has a simple sincerity, a bit of \"artless art\", that calls to mind that place he's come so far from, yet carries forever.\nIn the course of our Sound-In events, one of my main contributions is to gather some of the various improvised tracks that have come in that day, cobble them together into a mash-up that magically becomes an integral whole, and then slap my own title onto that result. Way back when, while making one of these mash-ups that happened to strongly feature Jim Goodin playing, my mind keyed on the old song \"The Arkansas Traveler\". The Appalachian idea of The Traveler seemed to just jibe naturally with whatever vibe Jim's playing was giving off, and did again and again during subsequent Sound-In events. So was born my own fuzzy mythology of our Traveler, as represented by Jim's music and voice.\nOver the years, there grew to be quite a number of \"Traveler\" pieces from these mash-ups, and I thought it might be a good idea to collect them into a single album; to let other listeners wander through this modern-day-set of sonic folktales. Though these are mash-ups of contributed tracks from many different musicians all over the country and world, working in all sorts of styles, the common thread of Jim's improvisations pulls them all into a weird sort of Americana. Admittedly an Americana that all kinds of other universes, ghosts and even monsters leak through the cracks, but Americana nonetheless.\nThis is a long collection; the length of a feature film, really. So maybe it's best to approach it as such, a collection of scenes, actions, atmospheres, that somehow tell the story of our Traveler.",

Impossible to pin down, with a deep sense of play and wonder, this collection based on improvisations is a series of snapshots, recording the momentary impulse, a half-remembered scene, and sometimes impossible objects made possible. The download includes cover art and liner notes.",

            "about": "Alexandra Cárdenas  (algorave.com/alexandra-cardenas/)  is a composer, programmer, and improviser, born in Bogotá, Colombia in 1976. She studied composition at the Universidad de Los Andes, where she also studied mathematics and classical guitar. She has performed in diverse venues across the Americas, Europe, and Asia.\nUsing open-source software like SuperCollider and TidalCycles, her work is focused on the exploration of the musicality of code and the algorithmic behavior of music, especially through the practice of live-coding. This is a way of creating music in an improvisatory manner, by typing and editing computer code directly into the laptop to create sound as the performance progresses. Often the code itself is displayed to the audience during the performance.\nWith her intense activity as performer and teacher of live-coding, Alexandra is among the pioneers of live-coding in electroacoustic music and part of the forefront of the what's become known as the Algorave scene. Currently she is based in Berlin, Germany, where she completed her Masters in Sound Studies at the Berlin University of the Arts.\nThis EP is a recording of live-coded performance Alexandra gave at HIPERSÓNICA @platohedro in Medellín, Colombia on March 17th, 2017, for the sixth anniversary of the birth of ALGORAVE  (algorave.com)\nA video of the actual live-coding as it happened can be seen at YouTube:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0SHPk3H72Y",

            "about": "Since early 2009, various musicians around the world have checked in weekly at a web site known as ImprovFriday  (improvfriday.ning.com).  From Thursday afternoon (US Pacific time) through Saturday evening, any and all are free to share newly composed or improvised tracks, hear each other’s work, discuss and connect.\nPart of my own working style these past 30 years is the mash-up, remix, or audio collage. Never being much of a live performer, averse to microphones and limited in the equipment I could call my “studio,” I’ve often resorted to integrating (or sometimes, dissembling) others’ recorded music and sound into newly composed pieces of my own.\nImprovisation is often performed solo, but just as often as a group venture. At ImprovFriday we had many great solo tracks being offered up; yet many times I’d be struck by how sympathetic this artist’s track was with another’s, and would imagine how wonderful if the distance between us became immaterial and these two, three or four could be playing in the same space and time. And well, given that we were dealing with recordings, why not? By using my own expertise I could bring the individual tracks together, bring people into the same “room” as it were, and create wholly new and convincing works in the process.\nA very few of these tracks were altered in any drastic way, which is why I don‘t think of them as “remixes;” rather, most of the tracks heard here are left largely intact, simply laid over and against one another, with just some fades and general spatial processing applied (all of the mash-ups were made using only Adobe Audition as my “instrument“). To me the process is much closer to ikebana -- the Japanese art of flower-arranging. There’s an abstract element of storytelling at work, too, though the specific story told by the title came only after the piece was finished.\nIn the spirit of the improvisation that so many of these tracks were first performed and recorded in, I chose to work only with tracks offered up during that particular session, and I also chose to try and create each new mash-up within the span of a half-hour to and hour, no more, from the selection of source tracks to the posting of the final mix. I wanted to give a sense of coherence and real interplay, but also to leave as much of their individual voices and free spirits intact as well.\nI owe a huge debt of gratitude to these wonderful musicians (all now friends); in the end, whatever I’ve been able to do here is only made possible by the creativity and musicianship that each of them has shown and shared.\n-- Steve Layton / Pompano Beach, FL / March 2011",

            "about": "Since early 2009, various musicians around the world have checked in weekly at a web site known as ImprovFriday  (improvfriday.ning.com).  From Thursday afternoon (US Pacific time) through Saturday evening, any and all are free to share newly composed or improvised tracks, hear each other’s work, discuss and connect.\nPart of my own working style these past 30 years is the mash-up, remix, or audio collage. Never being much of a live performer, averse to microphones and limited in the equipment I could call my “studio,” I’ve often resorted to integrating (or sometimes, dissembling) others’ recorded music and sound into newly composed pieces of my own.\nImprovisation is often performed solo, but just as often as a group venture. At ImprovFriday we had many great solo tracks being offered up; yet many times I’d be struck by how sympathetic this artist’s track was with another’s, and would imagine how wonderful if the distance between us became immaterial and these two, three or four could be playing in the same space and time. And well, given that we were dealing with recordings, why not? By using my own expertise I could bring the individual tracks together, bring people into the same “room” as it were, and create wholly new and convincing works in the process.\nA very few of these tracks were altered in any drastic way, which is why I don‘t think of them as “remixes;” rather, most of the tracks heard here are left largely intact, simply laid over and against one another, with just some fades and general spatial processing applied (all of the mash-ups were made using only Adobe Audition as my “instrument“). To me the process is much closer to ikebana -- the Japanese art of flower-arranging. There’s an abstract element of storytelling at work, too, though the specific story told by the title came only after the piece was finished.\nIn the spirit of the improvisation that so many of these tracks were first performed and recorded in, I chose to work only with tracks offered up during that particular session, and I also chose to try and create each new mash-up within the span of a half-hour to and hour, no more, from the selection of source tracks to the posting of the final mix. I wanted to give a sense of coherence and real interplay, but also to leave as much of their individual voices and free spirits intact as well.\nI owe a huge debt of gratitude to these wonderful musicians (all now friends); in the end, whatever I've been able to do here is only made possible by the creativity and musicianship that each of them has shown and shared.\n-- Steve Layton / Pompano Beach, FL / March 2011",

            "about": "As far back as high school I knew I wanted to be a composer; perhaps I should say I knew I would be a composer. With a lot of study, college, and university, that's just what I became. But I realized that I didn't want to stay within \"the system\" and teach, meaning that once outside that system of resources and support any performances would be very, very few, and very, very far between. Yet I didn't want to be writing works that only ended up in a drawer.\nWhile live performances are a wonderful thing, I'm also a child of the age of recorded music. Relatively few people can hear any one performance, but a single recording can be heard by anyone in the world, any time, even long after my death.\nGiven those realities I decided I would mostly abandon score-writing, instead creating, realizing and recording all of my works by myself. I'd studied electronic music, electroacoustic music and synthesizers quite a bit back in school, so with the gradual availability of personal recording equipment and synthesizers, and the new MIDI instrument protocol, I began to be able to create fairly elaborate pieces, and fairly good recordings. The sound of these works of the 1980s and 90s was mostly electronically-oriented, playing keyboards and other devices to create all of the sounds.\nIn 1998 I bought my first PC, and with it my first complex music sequencing program. With it, I was suddenly able to quickly \"write\" music again in a way that very closely resembled to old days of pen on paper. Rather than going back to regular notes on a staff, I found it was just as easy to write the notes for each part in its own \"piano roll\" track. And not only could I escape the tyranny of the bar, beat, and even note subdivision, at the same moment as I was writing the piece I was also shaping a finished performance, one that could be committed to a recording as soon as the piece was done. All of this led to a kind of explosion over the next ten years, a flood of music from my fingers to the software to the recording.\nNone of these works were played using music keyboards; all of them were composed note-by-note in the sequencer. When the piece was finished being composed & written it was then recorded all in one moment, using either hardware or software synthesizers all passing through a single specific \"hall\" reverb. The pieces collected here are ones I consider \"orchestral\". Some are chamber-sized, to be sure, but most call for large to very large ensembles of instruments. The instrumental sounds are often realistic, but also often deliberately less so. If regular concert performance by real players is thought of as analogous to theater, what I do, and fully embrace, is more akin to film or animation. The instruments, the players, the hall maybe be unreal, but every note, sound, dynamic, attack, are completely real, created my own hand with my composer's knowledge of orchestration and performance practice. In some future time, if some other person wanted to create actual full scores for live performances, the MIDI sequence scores are all still preserved and with a bit of effort could be wrestled into normal score format. But that isn't my concern. I simply wanted to get as much music as possible out of my head and preserved as SOUND, to keep it out of the drawer and perhaps find its way into the open ears of another.\nOf course, all the time that I've been exploring this new form of classical composition, I've also continued creating countless other works in a more purely electroacoustic and electronic vein, and around 2010 a shift in equipment and interests led me to do more and more of that and less and less \"orchestral\" writing. Though I still \"write\" music in the sequencer every day, it's a complete unknown whether I'll again focus on these kinds of scores again. Whether I do or not doesn't really interest me. I'm not beholden to any one musical style or philosophy; I love and recognize the value of ALL music, both in the listening and in the making. In the meantime, I give you this rather vast collection, of a hundred different colors and a dozen different styles, so to live in my personal sonic world for a few hours.\nSteve Layton / Seattle, WA / June 2018",

The sources range from my own voice, to field recordings, to readings by three poets: Dorota Czerner  (www.foreigner.de/article_dorota_richardson_notes.html),  Céline Lory  (www.celinelory.net),  and Susan Gevirtz  (www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/sgevirtz).

Jude often sings, but had a bad cold and was wanting to just make some instrumental/sound tracks with her MicroKorg. I said sure, just send along tracks as she made them, and I would process, mix and match them, add some of my own performances in Reason, and we'd see where it took us. By Nov 14th these five tracks were the result of that process.",

            "about": "A first collection of my earlier electronic work, from the analog days with just a Roland Jupiter-4 synth & TR-606 drum box, Casio VL-tone, and a stereo cassette deck, through the early digital (but pre-computer) days with a Casio CZ-101 synth and DH-100 MIDI horn, Roland S-10 sampler, Yamaha TX-81z synth and QX-5 sequencer, Alesis HR-16 drum machine, going to a Fostex 200 4-track cassette deck. Everything was rescued from cassette tapes in various states of age and disrepair; while cleaned and balanced a bit, the sound quality is what it is. While the sound may not always be \"technicolor\", the tracks capture an immediacy, freshness, and sheer seat-of-the-pants creativity in making these pieces single-handed in the corner of my various apartment living rooms.",

            "about": "The second collection of my earlier electronic work from the digital (but pre-computer) days, with a Casio CZ-101 synth and DH-100 MIDI horn, Roland S-10 sampler, Yamaha TX-81z synth and QX-5 sequencer, Alesis HR-16 drum machine, Yamaha TG-33 synth, going to a Fostex 200 4-track cassette deck. Everything was rescued from stereo cassette tape dubs from the original 4-track masters, in various states of age and disrepair; while cleaned and balanced a bit, the sound quality is what it is. While the sound may not always be \"technicolor\", the tracks capture an immediacy, freshness, and sheer seat-of-the-pants creativity in making these pieces single-handed in the corner of my various apartment living rooms.\nA word: A few of the tracks are fairly long \"suites\" of movements. While I might have broken them into their respective movements, they were always meant to be listened to together.\nI done did it all myself, and it made me happy.\n-- Steve Layton, Seattle, 2021",

The title is taken from the final section of T.S. Eliot's iconic poem \"The Wasteland\":\nAfter the torch-light red on sweaty faces\nAfter the frosty silence in the gardens\nAfter the agony in stony places\nThe shouting and the crying\nPrison and place and reverberation\nOf thunder of spring over distant mountains\nHe who was living is now dead\nWe who were living are now dying\nWith a little patience",

            "about": "In September 2016, my friend and fellow musician Bill Newbold shared the MIDI file for a piece he was working up, entitled \"Voices in the Head: As the Voices Chatter 1\" (This original is included here as track #2. Keep in mind that both tracks on this album are realizations from the exact same MIDI file, with no notes changed at all.) I thought it might be fun to take Bill's MIDI file, keep all of his own notes, structure, and performance, but replace all of the actual instrument sounds, and remix the whole thing into a parallel yet new context. In my mind, the resulting sound called up the famous 19th-century supernatural Japanese kabuki play \"Yotsuya Kaidan\".\nThe condensed story as found in Wikipedia:\nAct 1:\nTamiya Iemon, a rōnin, is having a heated exchange with his father-in-law, Yotsuya Samon, concerning Samon's daughter Oiwa. After it is suggested by Samon that Iemon and his daughter should separate, the ronin becomes enraged and murders Samon. The next scene focuses on the character Naosuke who is sexually obsessed with Oiwa's sister, the prostitute Osode, despite her being already married to another man, Satô Yomoshichi. As this scene begins, Naosuke is at the local brothel making romantic advances toward Osode when Yomoshichi and the brothel's owner, Takuetsu, enter. Unable to pay a fee demanded by Takuetsu, he is mocked by both Yomoshichi and Osode and forcibly removed. Shortly thereafter an intoxicated Naosuke murders Okuda Shôzaburô, his former master, whom he mistakes for Yomoshichi. This is implied to occur at the precise time of the slaying of Samon. It is at this point that Iemon and Naosuke unite and conspire to mislead Oiwa and Osode into believing that they will exact revenge on the people responsible for their father's death. In return Osode agrees to marry Naosuke.\nAct 2:\nOume, the granddaughter of Itô Kihei, has fallen in love with Iemon. However, believing herself to be less attractive than Oiwa, she doesn't think Iemon will ever want to become her husband. Sympathizing with Oume's plight, the Itôs scheme to have Oiwa disfigured by sending her a topical poison disguised as a facial cream. Oiwa, unbeknownst to her at the time, is instantly scarred by the cream when she applies it. Upon seeing his wife's ghastly new countenance, Iemon decides he can no longer remain with her. He asks Takuetsu to rape Oiwa so that he will have an honorable basis for divorce. Takuetsu cannot bring himself to do this so, instead, he simply shows Oiwa her reflection in a mirror. Realizing that she has been deceived, Oiwa becomes hysterical and, picking up a sword, runs towards the door. Takuetsu moves to grab her but Oiwa, attempting to evade him, accidentally punctures her own throat with the sword's tip. As she lies bleeding to death before a stunned Takuetsu, she curses Iemon's name. Not long after, Iemon becomes engaged to Oume. Act 2 closes with Iemon being tricked by Oiwa's ghost into slaying both Oume and her grandfather on the night of the wedding.\nAct 3:\nThe remaining members of the Itô household are annihilated. Iemon kicks Oyumi, the mother of Oume, into the Onbô Canal and Omaki, the servant of Oyumi drowns by accident. Naosuke arrives in disguise as Gonbei, an eel vendor, and blackmails Iemon into handing over a valuable document. Iemon contemplates his prospects while fishing at the Onbô canal. On the embankment above the canal Iemon, Yomoshichi and Naosuke appear to fumble as they struggle for possession of a note which passes from hand to hand in the darkness.\nAct 4:\nAt the opening Naosuke is pressuring Osode to consummate their marriage, to which she seems oddly averse. Yomoshichi appears and accuses Osode of adultery. Osode resigns herself to death in atonement and convinces Naosuke and Yomoshichi that they should kill her. She leaves a farewell note from which Naosuke learns that Osode was his younger sister. For the shame of this, as well as for the killing of his former master, he commits suicide.\nAct 5:\nIemon, still haunted by the ghost of Oiwa, flees to an isolated mountain retreat. There he rapidly descends into madness as his dreams and reality begin to merge and Oiwa's haunting intensifies. The act closes with Yomoshichi slaying Iemon out of both vengeance and compassion.",
