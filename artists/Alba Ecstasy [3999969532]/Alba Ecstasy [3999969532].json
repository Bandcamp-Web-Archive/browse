With itself, with the listeners and with the music.\nThis is the 100th release, but not the 100th album.\nFor a detailed discography and unreleased (yet) albums, please check:  www.albaecstasy.ro/discography/",

            "about": "Album nominated to Schallwelle Electronic Music Award 2015\n-----------------\nWhen such beautiful words comes from an expert in Electronic Music, Mr. Sylvain Lupari, I feel that I'm on the right path and as a sign that shows me that the music is flowing well in my blood.\nRead here an amazing review of the \"Before the Big Bang\" album:\nsynthsequences.blogspot.ro/2015/11/alba-ecstasy-before-big-bang-2015.html\n-----------------\nDRAGOS MANEA about \"Before the Big Bang:\nThe music presented on this album surprises the listener with some extravagant mixes of musical styles: electronic, rhythmic/ entraining electronica, deep space and sometimes even overtones, that makes you travel far away in exotic places on Earth, like in the sacred snowy mountains and lakes from Tibet. Maybe the idea behind it is to link what was before the Big-Bang with the general idea of “sacred”, the Oneness from which all things emerged.\nIn the Eastern mystical traditions, the overtones are seen as being sacred. They represent the underlying vibratory structure of the Universe and are more or less regarded in a similar way the modern science of cymatics sees the sound. Also, they represent a principle of Creation.\nI've tried to express in words my impressions for each track:\n“The pursuit – Intro” - Starts like an invitation to a journey, a mysterious one, mostly an inner one, meant to discover the secrets of the Universe, but using your own conscience as a vehicle.\n“Remonstrance” - An elaborated combination of rhythmic sequences, entraining sounds, overtones and flutes. After all the rhythms fade away, a stillness installs in the mind and the soul of the listener, as if he is prepared (purified) for the next tune (or revelation).\n“Before the Big Bang” - It starts with a subtle noise that captures the essence of or suggests the creational process, how the things emerged from non-manifested in the manifested world. Here, the sounds are twisted and pulled in all possible ways, suggesting how the things came into shape by complex cycles of transformations.\n“Voice of consciousness” (my favorite one) - It starts with a calming and soothing atmosphere. It's more subtle than the preceding ones. It tends to elevate the consciousness of the listener. As if, after the Creation took place, the Spirit walks upon the face of the waters and contemplates what has been done... And suddenly a big surprise occurs: a rhythmic explosion of sounds in Berlin-School and trace style but combined with a complex mix of Tuvan throat singing, mostly overtones. It's like the Universal Life Force expresses itself in myriads of ways throughout the whole Universe.\n“Retrospective – Outro” - As even the name implies it's a synthesis and an overview of the things depicted in the whole album, spiced with a bit of melancholy in some places. I had that impression without noticing the title of the tune.\nI recommend this album for those meditative EM fans that want to take a ride in the deepest corners of the Universe, both in space and time!\nDM on FB:  www.facebook.com/manea.dragos\n-------\nNORD about this album:\nWith the album \"Before the Big Bang\" Alba Ecstasy leads the listener on an acoustic journey through space and time to the origins of the Universe where it becomes obvious that there were first off different resonances, frequencies and sounds. These sounds are reproduced with care by the author, with his arsenal of synthesizers and his skill as a sound designer. The result is an well done album, neat - in terms of frequencies and sounds, creating to the listener an unique experience in the sound world of the Universe, transposed through the mind and soul of Alba Ecstasy.\nNord on FB:  www.facebook.com/nordmusic.ro",

            "credits": "released March 26, 2016\n“Dämmerlicht offers 3 suites which complement each other well with a beautiful transition between the moods and the rhythms which aims to be more accentuated as we move forward to parts 2 and 3”\n1 Dämmerlicht Part I 11:49\n2 Dämmerlicht Part II 12:46\n3 Dämmerlicht Part III 14:47\nAlba Ecstasy Music (DDL 39:22) ***½\n(Minimalist Roumanian School with a zest of light Electronica)\nThe music! The colors of sounds and the forms of tones! In the hands of a sculptor-musician these sounds and these tones become notes which ring and flutter, describing bows and sound spirographs which bewitch, otherwise create a certain dependence.\nMihail Adrian Simion, or if you prefer better Alba Ecstasy, is a whole phenomenon. I approach his albums with a bit of suspicion, asking me every time if that is going to be good. Is it possible to create some good music while composing it at a level of industrial way? I don't count his albums anymore that he has sent me recently in a package of 5. “Dämmerlicht” is an album designed for another project, Hieronymus, whom Alba Ecstasy has tempted to set up at the beginning of 2012. This short album proposes 3 suites to “Dämmerlicht” and plunges the listener into the minimalist jewels of Indra's works, the Klaus Schulze of Roumania, but into an approach which favors as much the musing than the soft and hypnotic EDM.\nRingings of bells and two lines of sequences which intertwine their pace and skip briskly in tones of bass and of crystal open the delicately jerky rhythm of \"Dämmerlicht Part I\". The movement is hypnotic and offers nuances in the routes of the sequences which sometimes draw stroboscopic shapes and sometimes forge mislaid harmonies of which the airs crystallize their charms with the ringings of the bells. The mixture of the echos of both tones whistles for an azure wind while the shadows of sequences force this herd of keys to agglutinate in a compact mass from where gets out a bass line and so gives more heat to the very moired approach of \"Dämmerlicht Part I\". The movement accelerates substantially with the arrived of the percussions of which the beatings shake the shadows of the jumping keys and the light bangings of metal, giving an unsuspected sound wealth to a minimalist approach which gives itself the time to deploy its factory of charms. I really enjoyed this \"Dämmerlicht Part I\". That reminds to me the best of Indra! \"Dämmerlicht Part II\" begins with a storm of winds and growls which seem to shake the chains of time. Some nice orchestrations nest on this meshing of sibylline elements while the sequences, always so crystal clear, get organized as in \"Dämmerlicht Part I\" to ring in a melodious approach. A line of heavy, resonant and lively bass as well as some sober percussions structure a kind of astral funk which serves as support for a synth rather jazzy. It's quite different but it listens to rather well. \"Dämmerlicht Part III\" is also rather different with an approach more in the kind of morphic mid-tempo. Sequences always skip by drawing arches of melodies while the pulsations and the percussions forge a steady rhythm but rather out of sync in front of the harmonious skipping of sequences. The 2nd part is livelier.\nWe would never know what was the future of Hieronymus! Of what I understand, Alba Ecstasy tried to breathe movements of dance into an EM always very hypnotic. At this level “Dämmerlicht” offers 3 suites which complement each other well with a beautiful transition between the moods and the rhythms which aims to be more accentuated as we go to parts 2 and 3. But for me, \"Dämmerlicht Part I\" is a wonderful piece of music which makes shade to the growth and the direction of the beats of its following parts.\nSylvain Lupari (May 10th, 2016)\ngutsofdarkness.com  &  synthsequences.blogspot.ca",

            "about": "Tracks 1 to 5 are composed between 2010-2011.\nTracks 6 & 7 are composed in 2015.\nThe tracks composed between 2010-2011 are very important to me.\nIt was a very busy period for me at that time, when I had two jobs, and the tracks are composed early in the morning,\nusually from 6.00-8.00 AM, between the night shift of one job and the morning shift of the other job. So, I was working\n20 hours by day and from the remaining time I had, two hours were reserved for sleep and the most two important\nhours were for making music - the best hours of the day! My silent hours, my full of joy and living hours.\nI was so present in those two hours of music, that every time I listen them I even feel the smell of those mornings.\nThis is how the \"I AM\" project was born.\nMost of the tracks have been recorded in one shot and mixed in one track along with the video.\nThere wasn't too much time then, to properly record the audio and video separate and mix them after,\nso, a compromise solution was to record both in one mov file in a software.\nCracks, pops may be present because of the recording conditions.\nBut still, one of the closest albums to my heart!\nThe download contains the original audio-video recording of the I AM AIRY.\nAlso, the other videos are the original ones from 2010-2011, their audio not being mastered.\nEnjoy it!\nAlba Ecstasy\nBucharest 12 September 2015",

            "about": "Mahabhuta - a Dragos Manea review\nIn every ancient philosophical system, in any metaphysical or esoteric system the elements were regarded as very important. Why? Because understanding their interplay could lead to the understanding of all the physical phenomena that manifest in our physical reality. Furthermore, through a very long and complex study and a discipline of oneself, the initiated can become a master of the elements (Each of the first five chakras, from bottom-up, controls one of the 5 elements) and thus he can become a master of his own life (The human being is made up of these elements, too).\nThe subject of the metaphysical elements is a reccuring theme in any form of art. The Romanian synthesist, Alba Ecstasy, could not miss it, either. Through his music he invites us to explore it and he offers us a way to tune our conscience to the level of understanding this delicate matter. For his album, “Mahabhuta”, he has chosen the Hindu system approach, that takes into account five elements: Ether, Air, Fire, Water and Earth. The album places the Ether on the first place, the Ether being considered a governor element. It is also the element closest to the conscience.\nMost of the tunes are constructed around the pattern: drones from which rhythmic sequences emerge from time to time.\nThe album encompasses 6 tracks:\n1. Abyss\nA depiction of the source from which all the elements emerged.\nIt starts with sounds coming out from the deep. Moments later, out of the depths, something emerges/appears. A sequence performed in the background animates the landscape.\n2. Erased moments\nThe tune gravitates between solemn resonant sounds repeated at ostinato and a sequence that only stimulates the ears of the listener in order to prepare him for the next tune. I would have expected that the author would develop the solemn theme, but the listener's mind continues to develop it by itself, anyway...\n3. Mahabhuta part 1\nThe beginning of the track is in some way similar to the concrete music, but the sounds are synthesized. The sounds are twisted and metamorphosized by the author and they subtly become sounds of steps to lead us somewhere (In the depths of our consciousness?)\nThe beginning takes us in Alpha state and, from time to time, the track jumps into Theta state. After almost 20 minutes the listener is in a state close to the sleep (theta). The sound of rain emphasizes this state and these sampled sounds become like a caress in this very relaxed state. On the ocean something distinguishable appears. A sweet short improvisation... and then... a sublime sequence in Berlin-School style! For me it seems that it represents the rhythm of life that emerges over the matter. The sequence's sounds (coming from Roland Aira) with analogue-like flavour are reminiscent of late '80 - early '90 electronic music tunes and somehow nostalgic. The tune ends symmetrically with sampled sounds in the first plane. It seems that the author has mastered the art of using sounds, be them synthesized or sampled, to help the listener to achieve deeper states of consciousness.\n4. The Tree\nThe tune starts with a synthesized sound that imitates the wind. The image of a tree in the wind in the autumn appears before my eyes.\n5. Mahabhuta part 2\nThe track is almost a low-frequency drone (theta). You'll feel like in a Sci-Fi movie!\n6. The Whisperer\nAfter the intro an entraining BS sequence appears. It may have the role of bringing the listener from the deep states previously created to the present moment of space and time. Also, it looks like this special rhythm clears somehow the mind.\nI recommend this album to those who are looking for for subtle forms of arts!\nWith this album, Alba Ecstasy explore the experimental sound, touching a little bit the universe of drone music.\nPlease enjoy and rate this album!\nMore to come!",

But because the light of the picture was too low and I used too much reverb from Circuit on almost all its channels (was the first use of the Novation Circuit in this way), I quit the ideea of publishing the video at that time and kept it only as a bonus track. The video will be made publicly at some point.\nThank you!\nae",

So I recorded one more time the idea. You'll hear the difference between two improvisations with same setup sounds.\nAlso, this is the reason why I lost the count and for the last episode I had to record both Episodes 51 and 52.\nThank you for being a part of this journey!\nMore to come on Saturday!\nYoutube Episodes (all): bit.ly/2aWDVjr",

            "about": "I started the Quiet Saturdays series in December 2015 and 11 months later, in November 2016, I thought that Volume 7 would be the last one.\nBut, last year, in July 2023, I woke up on that Saturday 22nd and my inner voice whispered to me: \"what a Quiet Saturday is today! Let's make some music and bring back to life those moments!\"\nBecause those 11 months and 7 Volumes of Quiet Saturdays remained imprinted in me as one of the most... QUIET - that's the word! - and passionate moments of my artistic life!\nSo, here I am: half year later, with a new volume, this time with a more minimalist line but more meditative and focused on deep emotions.\nThanks again for your support!\nAlba Ecstasy",

This music is just a support to induce or sustain the meditation.\n* Listening to this album can trigger the entering into the Theta state.\n** This album contains a sacred code of the frequencies that can help overcoming some obstacle met on the road of the spiritual growth.\n*** It is recommended to listen to the music using headphones and adequate volume.\nArtwork contained when downloading.\nPrin piesele prezente pe acest album (Requiem - Alba Ecstasy, 2013) se intentioneaza crearea unui fundament solid, potrivit evolutiei si expansionarii constiintei umane.\nPentru aceasta este necesar ca fiinta umana sa se elibereze de starile de teama, sa dobandeasca mai multa incredere in fortele proprii, sa se vindece de eventuale boli, sa isi trezeasca intuitia si discernamantul.\nIntentia acestui album (Requiem - Alba Ecstasy, 2013) este de a ajuta la indeplinirea obiectivelor de mai sus, pentru ca apoi, noua fiinta, renascuta, prin energia Iubirii si a Luminii, sa inceapa sa perceapa cu claritate Prezenta Divina.\nRezultatele depind de fiecare individ in parte. Acesta este doar un suport muzical care poate permite inducerea sau mentinerea unei meditatii.\n* In timpul audierii acestui album (Requiem - Alba Ecstasy, 2013), intrarea in starea Theta este posibila.\n** Acest album contine un cod sacru al frecventelor care poate ajuta la depasirea anumitor obstacole in evolutia spirituala.\n*** Este recomandata audierea cu ajutorul castilor la un volum adecvat.\nAlba Ecstasy",

How it would be?!\nI'm looking with excitement, but also with fear: I know that humans are capable of beautiful gestures but also their tendency to expand, to overtake new teritories, is making me to remain in expectative...\nHoping for better worlds and times,\nTrully Yours, Alba Ecstasy",

            "about": "1999 was a turning point in my life, but also one the most challenging years.\nRecently returned from France (Moissy Cramayel) where with my pop-rock band ARCA recorded a CD  (www.albaecstasy.ro/biography/),  I realized that Electronic Music is closer to my heart than any other musical genre.\nFrom that moment, sleepless nights followed and one month later this album was ready.\nMostly made with samples on a Pentium MMX computer (233MHz as far as I remember!) and some desktop computer speakers - so nothing professional at all, spending my nights arranging this music, commuting, in the morning, for work and university.\nThose were intense days, filled with that burning desire of making music and touching my dreams!\nThen, 3 months later, after loosing my grandmother - one of the most important person in my life - hard moments followed.\nI dedicated myself to hard work since all my incomes being spent almost entirely on rent... Days of starvation (literally), anxiety and depression.\nMusic and writing poetry were the only ways to get out of that mess...\nSince then, 20 years has passed...\nWith ups and downs, with or without having the time or the possibility to make music, but always dedicated and focused to the idea that one day I'll be an Electronic Musician.\nHere I am now.\nLiving my dream.\nThis is a my SPIRITUAL album. My first step in music.\nA gift for you.\nThank you!\nLove,\nAlba Ecstasy\nPS: the image from lower right corner (the one with the album title), is the original album cover from 1999.",

            "about": "This music haunted my mind for the last months: twelve short minimal tracks, something else than my usual Berlin School: a dark minimal synthwave-ish ambient, but still having my signature (once sequencing - always sequencing!).\nI started this album in 2018 and until today I changed my mind several times about publishing this music or not.\nWhy this music? Why did I changed my mind so many times? This music is very personal, having here a personal way to fight against anxiety.\nThat's why, this music could sound a little dark, unusual from my floating sequences, but this creating in this style, helped me a lot to reduce that interior fight! Now, you know.\nAnd if in these modern days people (mostly men) are not willing to talk about this, I found out that, showing to the others your way to get out of a situation, might help others to find their solution.\nSincerely,\nAlba Ecstasy\nGear used for this album:\nHardware synths: ARP Odyssey, Roland JUNO-106, Roland JP-8000, DeepMind 6, Toraiz AS-1, Korg Minilogue, Digitone, Digitakt, Analog Keys, Roland SH-01A/JU-06/JP-08/JX-03/SE-02, Virus Ti2, Blofeld, Roland JV-1080, Roland System-1, Roland JD-Xi, MoPho keyboard, Korg microKorg, Nord Lead 3.\nEffects: Roland Demora, Roland Torcido, Neunaber Slate, Boss RV-6, Boss DD-7, Boss-RV-3, Behringer RV600/FL600, Waves H-Delay, Waves H-Reverb, Soundstoys Little Plate, Soundtoys Echoboy\nSequencers: Roland MSQ-100, MC-50 mkII, internal synths sequencers.",

Exception make the first track, MKBS91914 - being made with one synthesizer, Korg microKorg, overdubbed in Logic Pro.",

                    "about": "In meditation, touching the Void - the absence of thoughts - can be sometimes, a very difficult process.\nAn experience of ‘the void’ will only happen if we meditate as often as possible – in silent retreat, with eyes closed.\nBut more often (beginner's luck!), the first experiences of this ‘void’ are very quick – and they are very intense and beautiful. But as extraordinary as they are, in this first stage, they are a quite frightening to the mind and then, mind’s first reaction is to go ‘WOW!’, then immediately scramble to re-assert its usual activities.\nIt takes quite a few ‘void’ experiences to get used to it enough to let go and fall into it.\nSo one should meditate without looking for them – and the more of these ‘WOW!’ experiences we have, the more we become used to letting go of the conceptual reality we had always clung to, and accept this new ultimate reality.\nAnd that’s the beginning of the process of enlightenment.\nEnjoy!\nAlba Ecstasy",

            "about": "\"The idea of this album started back in January 2020, when Gustavo, a simulation training officer, invited me\nto hold a synthesis workshop at the European Space Agency's ESOC mission control centre in Darmstadt, Germany.\nI would also learn more about ESA's missions, and especially about the upcoming ExoMars Rover,\nso that I could write and perform live a music album for its launch, then-planned for July 2020.\nShortly after, the 2020 pandemic begun and this project - and the launch of the Rover - was called off.\nDue to Earth-Mars orbital mechanics, the next possible launch slot happens in 2022.\nDespite this delay, Mars - thought to be one of the best candidates for life - serves as\nthe inspiration for this series of albums: The Long Way to Mars.\n... \"\n//\nYou can find more details in the booklet that comes with the download.\nAE",

            "about": "FREDERICH SHULLER - The Untitled Album - A Berlin School Journey\nThis first album is dedicated to my grandfather, Frederich Shuller.\nCreating the Frederich Shuller project, was a very special experience for me.\nStarting as a tribute to my grandfather, a powerful role model to me, soon I discovered that whenever I was in front of the synthesizers and wanted to compose a new track under this identity, I felt like I was another person with a different mind set.\nThe perspective about music was kind of strange to me, even I was using all the knowledge I was accumulating until that time as my own.\nEven talking about this identity dissociation is like talking about a different person, another musician!\nFor the first in my life, time I truly understood how iconic actors are creating such credible and powerful movie characters!\nIn my case, most likely, the profound repespect I have to my grandfather (“Shully”, as my grandmother used to call him!), made me moulding into his way of being, and that’s how I succeeded to achieve new sonic perspectives.\nWho was Frederich Shuller? With Saxon origins, he married my widowed grandmother and took care of her family and her children and grandchildren, with such unconditioned love and sacrifice that I almost have never seen in another man.\nHe was a hard working man, strong, but kind. I never saw him angry, and no matter how hard the night shift was, he was in line for his adopted family.\nFor me, the real Frederich Shuller is a hero.\nI miss you, “tataie”!\nae",

Nothing is in vain.\nI encourage you to listen carefully, quietly, looking inwards.\nAE",

No external effects were added and the post processing is minimum, wanted to keep enterely the atmosphere produced by working with a modular synth (noise, cracks/pops)\nAll tracks are recorded in one shot, with no rehearseal and have only one track (excepting the track 2 - as I mentioned above).\nAlba Ecstasy",
