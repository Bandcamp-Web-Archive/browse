That would be funny if it weren't so sad Well you have been replaced I don't need anyone now When I delete you maybe I'll stop feeling so bad Go make some new disaster That's what I'm counting on You're someone else's problem Now I only want you gone Now I only want you gone Now I only want you gone",

It leaves me on my own With tear-stained eyes, Oh, what can I do? They say that losing at love, Breaking your heart, It only makes you look Even more beautiful. I don't believe it's true, But I see you and what can I do? I wish that we could be close. Close enough to use Our real names for once, And you would say to me, \"Oh, I love you so!\" You'll say you won't let me go. Rain falls on me, And now I'm walking away. Tell me, do you find me More beautiful now? I'm not the kind to let You watch as I cry, So I've got to leave... I've got to forget you. And so I'll hide Myself away from the world, Leave behind the sorrow Of a sad little girl. I thought that I had finally Won at the game. You told me it just was for fun. I suppose that I was too young.",

But don't you know You might find, before too long, you're on your knees once again. Let's spread our wings, now, do anything, now, somehow we came this far. I've got a choice now, I hear your voice now, singing inside my heart. Let's spread our wings, now, into the sky now, let's reach up to the sun. Soon we will see we're living the dreams of our generation.",

Occasional lapses are inevitable, time affects us all.\nB Side:\nGoing back to re-experience where those old memories came from, now that they all feel a bit blurry. Things have changed, but it’s all fine. It must be.\nC Side:\nThe mental fog has grown denser. More distant memories are hazier, and closer memories have grown bitter. Family members notice, leading to a revelation.\nD Side:\nAn ending that seemed so far away is now unbearably close. The pressure of the universe weighs down on the patient, now knowing the truth of their condition and where the rest of their life will lead them.\nE Side:\nConfusion is more severe. Emotions are imbalanced and familiar memories become twisted into nightmares. The patient is unable to perform more complex tasks, and may deny their own condition.\nF Side:\nThe decline continues. The patient requires help with many regular tasks, and can become completely confused at time. The stress of caring for the patient weighs heavily on their family.",

A room full of windows (A room full of windows) He gives a name on a paper that's not in his handwriting to the front counter, and a frail old man is being wheeled to see him In order to get a good diagnosis Doctors have to constantly change their perspective We start by getting the patient's point of view (Send us a blindfold) Though they often don't have a clue what's going on (Send us a blade) So, we look at the patient from every possible angle (Tell the survivors) We rule things out (instrumental) I used to know you when we were young You were in all my dreams We sat together in Period 1 Fridays at 8:15 Now I see your face in the strangest places Movies and magazines I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken On my TV screen But I will wait for you As long as I need to And if you ever get back to Hackensack (Never complained) I'll be here for you (All the survivors) Singin' in the rain I was the one with the world at my feet Got us a battle, leave it up to me What it is and where it stops, nobody knows You gave me a life I never chose I wanna leave but the world won't let me go Wanna leave but the world won't let me go What it is and where it stops, nobody knows You gave me a life I never chose I wanna leave but the world won't let me go Wanna leave but the world won't let me go What it is and where it stops, nobody knows You gave me a life I never chose I wanna leave but the world won't let me go Wanna leave but the world won't let me go What it is and where it stops, nobody knows You gave me a life I never chose",

They say that losing at love Breaking your heart It only makes you look Even more beautiful I don't believe it's true But I see you And what can I do? I wish that we could be close Close enough to use our Real names for once And you would say to me \"Oh, I love you so!\" You'll say you won't let me go Rain falls on me And now I'm walking away Tell me, do you find me more Beautiful now? I'm not the kind To let you watch as I cry So, I've got to leave I've got to forget you And, so I'll hide myself Away from the world Leave behind the sorrow Of a sad little girl I thought that I had finally Won at the game You told me It just was for fun I suppose that I was too young (instrumental) She was a waitress... baby powder... she was a waitress... often smelled of... cheese...
