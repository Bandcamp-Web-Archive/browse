            "about": "Since its inception in 2019, the Porto based Eastern Nurseries label has released a string of noteworthy titles, yet the first two outings by Canadian Rifles, the solo moniker of label founder Rui P. Andrade, remain defining pillars in the label's discography.\nThese first two releases, Canadian Rifles ‘Eastern Nurseries’ album and the follow up single ‘Of Course I Still Love You / Geranium’ sprawl with acute emotive clangour and venerable opulence, their soundscapes conjuring visions of windswept cities, blemished technology and inherent tenderness.\nNow these works have been carefully reassembled on one expanded reissue, remastered by Daniele Antezza of Dadub mastering and featuring two new remixes by Dino Spiluttini and Burning Pyre.",

            "about": "Ever since Christoph de Babalon’s now classic 90’s ambient jungle breakbeat manifesto “If You’re Into It, I’m Out Of It” reemerged 5 years ago via a vinyl reissue on de Babalon’s own CFET imprint, a new wave of fans arose to greet the work with heralding praise.\nAfter cultivating his own sound for over 30 years, de Babalon has continually expanded his sonic trajectory throughout the last few years via a series of noteworthy release on labels such as Alter, A Colorful Storm and AD 93. Now he presents his most encompassing album to date via Vale, an hour long phantasmagoric onslaught showcasing the full spectrum of de Babalon’s radical, menacing and inimitable style.\nOne thing that becomes clear from the get-go when diving into Vale, is that it’s imbued with an air of restraint and forbearance, underscored by the many languishing voices and opaque, ominous ambient passages. These include the collaborative two piece ‘Arrethan’ with Polish singer and producer Antonina Nowacka, who previously made waves with her uncanny yet divine choral songs on her own album ‘Lamunan’, as well as pieces like ‘Good Morning, You Worm’, 'Demon Glue’ and ‘Denn Sie Sind Hünen’ which verge from the blissfully eerie to being suspended in a shadowy realm governed by sinister resonance.\nVale’s titular mid-point piece ‘I, Like Him (A Dream)’ showcases de Babalon’s at his most resourceful. Here a staccato of voices mutter in quick succession, (“I wish I could be like him! ugh..”) over an epiphany of nervous flutes and stumbling percussion, before finally dislodging into a cascade of glorious high flung volleys, like a deeply poignant, absurdist daydream come to life in full motion.\nWhere past albums have pushed de Babalon’s sound to its extremes, Vale is defined by its delicate balance between restraint and release. That is not to say it lacks any of the intimidating breakbeat onslaughts de Babalon has come to be known for. With the albums later pieces such as ‘I Pruned the Cat’ and ‘Pechvogel’ serving up unrelenting hardcore workouts, before reaching a fever peak on the album’s closer ‘Never Die’.\nOn Vale, de Babalon manages to showcase harmonic collisions that feel as bleak as they are bolstering. And herein lies the album’s true marvel; its rebellious nature, which dances between the lines of submissive dejection and revolting glee, offers us a captivating reflection of de Babalon himself – at a time when it seems like the entire world is marred between opposing forces and drowning in a surmounting sea of turmoil, submission, at least for him, is not an option.\nPRESS:\nCdB’s creative 2nd wind continues to blow away the breakcore shackles and reveal a tempestuous, gothic avant-classical spirit under the hood with a magisterial new opus ft. operatic vox by Antonina Nowacka\nWhile the vestiges of Christoph de Babalon’s mucky ‘90s birth in breakcore still litter ‘Vale’, the album presses on along vectors of horror cinematic invention that have broodingly defined his return to the fray over the past decade. The skeletal breaks are now often suppressed, slower and splayed, taking a backseat to arrangements of sampled instrumentation, synthetic bass, and the soaring vocal theatrics of Antonina Nowacka, who was a crucial presence as part of WIDT in their CdB collaboration ‘Teyas’ (2018). Ultimately the sound feels more grown up from the goth-punkish nature and rhetoric of albums such as his classic ‘If You’re Into It, I’m Out of It’, moving on from bedsit glower to full haunted house or raved-out abandoned Victorian asylum situation.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "Canadian violinist Christopher Whitley presents his first release of this year, ‘Landscape Shifts (Slight Return)ʼ, a collage of material derived from a 40 minute single movement piece that originally premiered in Austin, Texas earlier this year, composed by Christopher Whitley for small ensemble, electronics and projections.\nHaving been composed and performed a month before the Covid-19 related US shutdown, the piece was originally conceived in response to the Book How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by Jenny Odell, yet took on a new meaning as the core theme proved to be uncannily prescient in the following months of enforced statis and lockdown.\nThe work itself, split into two parts, evokes themes of solitary introversion and serene patience, imbedded in an tranquil ambiance featuring light movements of cello, voice, violin, piano, percussion and electronics, yet the piece never comes to feel cluttered as the small ensemble unfolds in a flurry of harmony throughout its 23 minute duration, as even in its busiest moments ‘Landscape Shifts (Slight Return)ʼ is as much about the music as it is about the silence in between the individual sounds, giving the work an acute sense of intimacy that offers listeners a moment of sincere respite in these turbulent times.",

            "about": "In 2019, Copenhagen based sound artist and composer Sofie Birch embarked on a trip to Colombia, it was here where she began collecting a wide array of field recordings, from bird song to Colombian instruments and jungle ambiance.\nDuring her time in Colombia, Sofie continuously gathered a series of soundscapes and, with the aid of some pre-recorded synths and pads, merged these sonic recollections into one long form piece.\nThe result, ‘Hidden Terraces’, comes in form of an audible postcard split into two movements, ‘Morgenånder’ (Morning Spirits) and ‘Vidsyn’ (Broad Views), each of which reveal Sofie sonically painting a diary of her journey, while encapsulating her moods and thoughts from her time spent in the South American Jungle.\nFollowing the unprecedented wake of events that saw world wide travel suspended and entire populations in quarantine, ‘Hidden Terraces’ presents us with a sense of freedom, it’s mood encapsulating the core thematic of wanderlust, a yearning feeling to explore and experience the world around us.\nIn the end, ‘Hidden Terraces’ undeniable potential lies in the fact that it lets our minds roam freely in a time of tumultuous, restraining isolation, and even if only for a brief moment, helps us grasp some sense of serenity beyond the confinements of our home.",

            "about": "A series of solemnly transcendent long form works by the ever prolific Kevin Drumm, ranging from pieces dedicated to Peter Rehberg & Joe Camarillo, to remedial drones and sublime harmonic balms, all produced between a time period of 12 months.\nPRESS:\nIneffably stunning long-form drift/drone works from Kevin Drumm, created over a year-long period and existing in the same frozen realm as his classic \"Imperial Distortion\" / \"Imperial Horizon\" sides. Highly immersive work recommended if you’ve enjoyed material by Stephan Mathieu, Eliane Radigue, Phill Niblock, Andrew Chalk.\nDrumm is a prolific musician, no doubt, but that shouldn't give you any reason to miss one of his finest - and most moving - releases in years. \"120121\" hits a somber note, memorialising Drumm's friends Peter Rehberg and Joe Camarillo, the Chicago drummer who died in January last year. But as much as it hovers around a pensive mood, there's no shortage of hope coursing through the album's six extended compositions. The sound shimmers and sways as if piped down from the heavens, striking a chord that links liturgical music with the stretched, minimalist experimentations of Eliane Radigue or Drumm's occasional collaborator Phill Niblock.\n'Far Off From Difference’ starts things off with a cluster of sustained tones that throb and drift barely perceptibly. Listen closely, however, and you’ll find a world of microtonal, almost orchestral flourishes in miniature, reminding us of Stephan Mathieu's angelic \"Radioland”.\n'MayorOfPosen' is the album's lengthy centrepiece, using a 20-minute runtime to expand on a single, sustained organ note, bobbing listlessly in an ocean of harmonics and blurred textures. 'Grey Screen' is almost as generous, but sidesteps sacred sounds in favour of more minimal oscillations that suggest harmony through unsettling dissonance. The most unexpected track is 'C', taking a saturated tape drone and extending it over 10 minutes, lifting it towards the sky.\nIn a landscape that's filled with nameless drone and ambient recordings more concerned with replication than exploration, it's nourishing to hear an artist like Drumm digging thru the recesses to keep up a level of quality that's genuinely startling to witness this many years into his career.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "4-Track Guitar Music is the unassuming title of a cassette by Swedish composer Mats Erlandsson, which was originally released on Kali Maloneʼs and Maria W. Hornʼs XKatedral label in 2018. Composed using only, as the album title implies, a 4-track tape deck and an electric guitar, the music was later modified on the computer and re-amplified in the machine hall of Ställbergs Gruva, a disbanded Swedish iron mine.\nThe music is primarily composed using melodic motifs and canonical structures in which a set of pitches are transposed in octaves and delayed, creating an ever-evolving cyclical polyphony. Contrary to the albumʼs modest title, the music is a tour-de-force of exuberance and stoic catharsis, continuously bordering on a sense of ecstatic serenity, sincere contemplation and restraint.\nNow Vaagner is proud to present the work on vinyl for the first time via a fully remastered reissue of 4-Track Guitar Music, with the Double LP including a bonus track titled \"Cellar\" by Mats Erlandsson which was not included on the original release.\n~\nAs a composer, musician and sound artist, Mats Erlandsson is part of the vibrantly reemerging field of drone music in Stockholm, Sweden, and is associated with practices characterized by the extensive use of sustained sound.\nErlandsson has undergone studies in composition in Stockholm, where he received a Masterʼs degree in Composition of Electronic Music. In addition to his own artistic practice, Erlandsson holds a position as studio assistant at the world-renowned Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) in Stockholm. He presents his work both as a solo artist and in collaborations, most notably together with Yair Elazar Glotman.",

            "about": "Soviet Utopias; The Ninth nuclear city of Pripyat’ was the title to a personal investigation about a town that has been largely forgotten by history; Pripyat.\nLocated in the Northern Ukraine, Pripyat was situated just next to the city of Chernobyl and served as the second largest municipal to accommodate power plant workers and scientists of the former Soviet Union. Then one fateful event changed the lives of these 50,000 individuals, leaving the entire nuclear city and its landmarks vacant.\nCrosspolar, himself originally hailing from a former Soviet state, explores this topic sonically on 51.2763° N, 30.2219° through the aid of FM-transmitters and receivers, furthermore he re-recorded audio in physical locations to imprint the sonic characteristic and traits of the former nuclear city.\nThe conceptual framework of the album was conceived from a series of documented interviews, all held former Pripyat residents, recorded by the label with the consent of each participant.\nThe outcome sees Crosspolar reflect on the subject matter through a sonic palette that fittingly recalls both, utopian futurism and dystopian void. Themes of decay and desolation are as present as moments of emotional reconciliation and monumental grandeur.\nIn the end the album forms the basis for a cultural sound exchange, an experiment that prompts the question; in what ways can we re-approach history through a sonic lens?\nWhile these pieces remain personal insights, they can also act as conduits to raise awareness about the subject matter, further acting as a basis for exploring our collective obsession with the past and how we choose to remember it.\nSupport the artist here:  crosspolar.bandcamp.com\nFollow the artist here:  twitter.com/crosspolar",

            "about": "Subliminal moments, suspended fragments, caught between time zones.\nComprised from a selection of soundscapes created by Aleksandra Zakharenko throughout various stages of last year, 7/37/2.11 acts as an auditory journal chronicling the fluctuating states of vague ambiguity the artists faced during the unprecedented turmoil of 2020.\nPress:\nPerila casts her slow burn, drowsy magic on Vaagner’s A Sunken Mall sublabel, drawing on the ambiguous nuance of daily life for another diaristic entry to her quietly expanding, precious catalogue.\nContinuing to occupy a personalised corner of the contemporary ambient sphere, somewhere between Félicia Atkinson and claire rousay’s liminal tone and Burial’s South London nightscapes; Perila transmutes fleeting feelings into a singular sort of ephemeral ambience richly textured with field recordings and laced with her signature spoken recitals (here edged from ASMR and into more audible room volume), slowly venting her thoughts. If you’ve had even half an ear on this realm over the past few years, we hardly need to describe it any further - but suffice it to say that this one is a deeply satisfying entry to the microcosm.\nThe album is a more serenely intimate experience then much of what we’ve heard from Perila before, relaying observations in low-lit settings that settle the listening space to her tenor. ‘Long Dizzying Air Through a Balcony Door’ lures in with long, healing, sferic pads, and ‘Amorphous Absorption’ feels to drop the temperature a few degrees, condensing into icier drips. The title and spare tone of ‘Haven’t Left Home 4 4 Days’ is uncannily on the mark - we know that feeling all too well - with a dream-pop tone recalling Teresa Winter at her quietest, with ‘Crash Sedative’ surgeon off any slumber feels with beautifully quizzical, whimsical flurry of keys, but the final send off leaves us in ‘1 Room’, with what sounds like a stray Theo Parrish chord sequence drifting in from the street, as the day blurs into the next.\n<3\n-Boomkat\nArtworks inspired by lockdowns, social distancing and other consequences of the pandemic have been trickling out for the past year and a half. Despite the early zeitgeist jubilantly calling for collective experiences, each of them only further cemented the opposite - just how differenttly all of us were affected by the unfolding events. Some musicians shaped their music into shallow, one-way confessionals or sonified pep talks. Others, like Alexandra Zakhareno aka Perila, transformed their visceral experiences into spaces of coping and empathy.\nThe Russian-born, Berlin based musician's take on ambient has always been defined by a diaristic, borderless sense of intimacy and overwhelming emotion. Yet the six miniatures recorded and released gradually on Bandcamp during quarantine and now compiled on 7.37/2.11 manage to bridge us even deeper into her personal space. On the opening 'Long Dizzying Air Through A Balcony Door', a pillow of murmurs, shimmering snyth pads and glimpses of field recording shuffles around shadows, caressing and embracing Zakharenko's voice. \"Spring air brings comforting nostalgia\", she sighs, tired. The cut's undulating texture breathes in and out with her, creating a suggestive state of warmth and making us observers and participants in her daily routine.\nSimultaneously, the sense of unease that emanates from this and all other tracks is inescapable, even as 'Amorphous Absorption' and 'Haven't Left Home 4 4 Days' enjoy moments of brightness in hissy patterns of tone, flickers of careless humming and comforting sounds akin to gently chiming steel pans. '\" was driving a car\", Zakharenko whispers through 'This Story Doesn't Make Sense' while pulsing beats and faint bleeps refract around the lines. \"I wasn't driving really. It was just my dream\", she replies to herself before falling into the feathery lull of a rustling piano ostinato on 'Crash Sedative'.\n-Antonio Poscic, The Wire\nThe world of Aleksandra Zakharenko is built from pin drops, footsteps, the silence between breaths. Her songs require deep listening because anything less would disturb the subtle rhythms of her music.\nOn her latest release as perila, 7.37/2.11, the Russian-born, Berlin-based artist continues her diaristic approach to composition, capturing recordings made over the course of 2020. But while song titles like “Haven’t Left Home 4 4 Days” might suggest a kind of dire response to pandemic restrictions, her tones suggest a more introspective state. Dusted with a layer of tape hiss, 7.37/2.11 is a particularly cozy reflection of a lonely year. “Being intimate with yourself is the way to avoid becoming robotic in this crazy whirlwind society,” Zakharenko told Pitchfork earlier this year. The warm piano of “Crash Sedative” certainly suggests that time spent in isolation drew Zakharenko towards more acoustic elements.\n-Arielle Gordon, Bandcamp",

            "about": "Not much is really known about the production process behind the sprawling works of Japanese composer Yosuke Tokunaga, nor about the artist himself. Yet this might be his most accomplished work to date, with 8 Quadrants yielding unique soundscapes that lunge and retreat in near mechanical movement, while warm volleys of low flung claps and thumps disperse over a bed of textural hums and lingering chords.\nAt times, Yosuke’s work manages to somehow form an atmosphere that can both feel airy and yet dense simultaneously; it is this juxtaposed mélange of sonic fabric that is at the core of his unique creations, and once again this is beautifully displayed on Yosuke’s latest outing, ‘8 Quadrants’, where he continues his unique practice of figuratively interpreting language through a sequence of delicate sonic sculptures.\nPRESS:\nEverything travels in circles. 8 Quadrants is built on overlain repetitions running at disparate speeds. Percussive sounds spin through tight-knit delays, while melodies repeat after extended exchanges between sweeping synth chords or chopped-up piano. At points there are even “beats”, manifest as skeletal trip hop of thuds and claps and silences, or something resembling cannonballs being metronomically launched into the water; always in a discernible pattern, yet slow enough to verge on arhythmic. There’s no single tempo, and thus the perception of pace fluctuates depending on where one applies focus. Concentrate on those somersaulting delays and the music appears to hurtle at some speed; settle on the intersecting tidal ambiences and 8 Quadrants isn’t moving at all – the motions cancel eachother out and leaving just a back-and-forth tilt, like a small boat in restless harbour.\nAmidst the flux of contradictory signals, the dominant feeling is that things aren’t quite connecting. The loops are misaligned. The textures, evoking both dreamt hazy gardens and clattering eroded junk, fail to find a midpoint between their disparate atmospheres. Like a hypothesis haunted by small pockets of incoherence, or a committee suspended in eternal deliberation, the album just hangs in the margin between the attempt and its fulfilment. It never gets there. Aptly, the half-hour duration feels just a fraction too short (and thus perfect), emulating the record’s lush spatial absences by making the post-runtime yearning apart of the experience itself – negation, and what does not occur, is rendered as vividly as that which positively manifests.\nJack Chuter, ATTN:Magazine\nSounding similar to the output of Vladislav Delay and Tim Hecker, Japanese producer Yosuke Tokunaga serves up a dense ambient album for Vaagner, featuring eight electro-acoustic quadrants, each permeating otherworldly timbres for desolate dimensions and introspective moments.\nPropelled by a wheezing drone mechanism, an interstellar vehicle perhaps, 'Quadrants' creates a dense vacuum enhanced with clanging metallics and digitised bleeps. Resulting in a haunting soundtrack for a distant future.\nTom Durston, Inverted Audio\nVaknar unveil eight soundscapes from shadowy Japanese producer Yosuke Tokunaga that join the dots between psychedelic ambient sounds, glitch music and dusty half-speed trip-hop. If Jan Jelinek had been on Mo'Wax...\nIt's easy to forget the huge fingerprint Japan had on the trip-hop movement. Not only appropriating Japanese imagery, Mo'Wax also made sure artists like Major Force and DJ Krush were given a platform outside of Japan, and the scene only deepens when you look closer. We're don't have much info about Yosuke Tokunaga but from the sound of \"8 Quadrants\" he was listening to at least some of this output. The record isn't trip-hop exactly, but that sample-based technique is in its DNA for sure. Beats aren't always audible but they're always present, and while the artist uses samples as freely and creatively as Jan Jelinek, there's a dustiness that transports us back to another era.\nThe best tracks are those that precisely capture this mood, blending murky cinematics with uneven thumps and white noise washes. 'Qua drants' almost harmonizes with Jake Muir's illbient-inspired \"Mana\", curving bendable jazz drums beneath smoked-out piano twinkles and swirling pads, while 'Quadr ants' sounds like a half-speed soundtrack to a spy movie set in a Tokyo suburb.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "Through its anthropological themes and fragmented process, 'A Wanderer' reflects on the imperfection of life itself, with its music existing somewhere between a series of recent recollections, and the frayed fabric of past lives.\nPRESS:\n(German)\nIm November legte das Berliner Label VAAGNER gleich drei neue Releases vor, die alle von japanischen Künstlern kommen. Neben Alben von Yuto Ohashi und yolabmi gehört dazu auch »« von Shuta Hikari, der in den vergangenen fünf Jahren höchst produktiv war. Die meisten der sieben Stücke scheinen auf Samples und Field Recordings zu basieren, nicht selten erinnert das Material dabei an ältere populäre oder tradierte japanische Musik, zwischendurch werden immer wieder Field Recordings erkennbar und arbeitet Hikari wie am Ende des Albums anscheinend mit Aufnahmen einzelner Instrumente. Der Titel bietet sich vielleicht als Schlüssel zum Verständnis dieser faszinierenden Platte an: Hier durchwandert jemand verschiedenste Klänge und bringt sie leichtfüßig in Bewegung.\n-Kristoffer Cornils, Fieldnotes",

            "about": "'An Embrace' is a collaborative project between the Bulgarian experimental music collective Amek and the German music label Vaagner.\nThe project was commissioned by Easterndaze, A Berlin based annual festival which fosters ties between Eastern & Western European labels through series of collaborative live shows.\nThis year, the 4th edition of the Festival had to be moved online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn a response to these new circumstances, Amek & Vaagner proposed a physical release titled 'An Embrace', inviting 8 artists from their respective regions to form duos and collaborate online, with each duo being asked to compose a piece inspired by the project's title.\nIn the end, 'An Embrace' became an ambitious effort that included multiple contributors and took months to complete, thus we are now proud to share the final result, which is comprised of a limited edition cassette tape featuring the four collaborative compositions, as well as a riso-printed zine which offers further insight into the participants creative processes, while also including additional poetry and texts by Jeremiah Carter, S. N., Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Krisztián Puskár and Stanimir Panayotov.\nWe hope you enjoy this special outing and we want to thank all the participants and contributors who made this project a reality.\nMastered by Tomas Boden\nThe project was funded by Musikfonds e.V. by means of the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media.",

Gorgeous music, for anyone into Basinski, Stephan Mathieu, or Pendant.\nOn \"An Opposite Fall\", released on Berlin's reliable Vaagner/Vaknar imprint, Tattersall bends piano sounds and tape loops into lulling, half-present pads that press against their saturated peaks, cracking as they distort. The opening side is warm and gentle, blessed with the same distant emotional quality as William Basinski's best work but possessing a subtle Northern charm. The piece dissipates in the final third, shifting from dense drone into echoing emptiness, with delicate piano improvisations set against household clatter.\n'An Opposite Fall' on the flipside sounds like a dreamworld variation of the first, abstracting its predecessor's warmth and drifting into thrumming melancholy bliss.\n-BOOMKAT",

            "about": "From the viscerally punishing and nerve wrecking, to the wistfully sublime, Kevin Drumm‘s work often yield a ferocious intensity through the timbres of minute details.\nOn ‘Battering Rams’, sinister forces interlope with glimmers of respite and contemplation, while recurring drones ceaselessly crescendo to near paralysing effect, only for the album's final moments to offer a lofty reprise of boundless oscillation, dispelling all the pent-up tension into a sanguine state of bliss. Once again, underpinning Kevin Drumms’ genius of transforming seemingly trivial sounds into elongated microtonal worlds that stay etched deeply in your conscious, often long after the work's final reverberations have subsided.\nNow, throughout this series of archival works dating from 2000 to 2022, his mastery is once again on full display and available via two new remastered formats.\nPRESS:\nAnother serene deployment from Chicago great Kevin Drumm, 'Battering Rams' is a dissociated crackle of damaged percussion and errant feedback that stabilizes into the kind of bleakly sensitive atmosphere you'd usually expect to find on the back of a short-run black metal tape.\n'Battering Rams' won't surprise any regular listeners but it's another worthy addition to the noise legend's canon, filling out the cloudier end of his sonic spectrum with more spacious industrial abstraction and the kind of pillowy drones we fell in love with the moment we first clapped our ears on 'Imperial Distortion'. The relative openness of 'Fire' wrong-foots us at first, with studio clatter amplified above an amplified whine that sounds like heavy machinery vibrating into obsoletion, but the mood shifts significantly on the brief 'Glory Only Once', heralded by eerie whistles.\nWe're led towards the crushing double blow of 'Dreams Now Major Events' and 'Old Shoes'. The former bends what sounds like synth choirs into bleak drones, slowly but perceptibly shifting the pitch and ramping up the tension, while the latter gives us the sweet release we've been waiting for, coaxing us towards the sublime. Here we're reminded of Drumm's most powerful serene material (think \"Imperial Horizon\"), lulled into a psychedelic slumber by billowing synths and distant keys.\n-Boomkat\nChicago experimentalist Kevin Drumm’s main platform for his music recently has been his Bandcamp page, where he posts single tracks exploring moods of the day or the season, often incorporating ambient sounds of rooms around his house.\nA subscription deal has tempted hundreds of listeners to sign up for regular updates from Drumm's home studio, yielding a weighty catalogue of work which, like Jim O'Rourke's Steamroom recordings on\nBandcamp, constitute a major new part of the artist's catalogue. The other side of Drumm's discography is made up of sporadic releases on labels such as A Sunken Mall, deep immersions in the mysteries and qualities\nof electroacoustic sound.\nBattering Rams consists of four pieces ofwildly differing lengths whose provenance are uncertain - even to Drumm himself - but were recorded sometime in recent years. “Fire” begins with the kind of dynamic, grinding physical battle familiar from his early guitar improvisations, before plugging into powerful swarms of opaque electronic noise. Like much of Drumm's work, the elements of the unknown and the unexpected are\na powerful drug.\n“Glory Once Only” is a one minute interlude glowing with the same shimmering drone textures as Drumm’s classic Imperial Horizon, which suggests the use of his favoured tone generators with delay and phase effects. The rest of Battering Rams consists of two ten minute tracks which explore the deepest depths of drone. “Dreams Now Major Events” has the unsettling feeling of Shepard Tones which appear to shift chaotically throughout. “Old Shoes” is one of those spectral Kevin Drumm pieces whose tones and harmonies feel close enough to touch but then shift imperceptibly, lie trying tofollow the colours of a sunrise.\nThe fascination of Kevin Drumm's work, whether in everyday recordings or surprise projects, is how with disparate tools he always manages to sound just like himself, and Battering Rams is another tantalising part\nof the puzzle.\n-Derk Walmsley.

            "about": "“Distinct arrangements of silky, swaying pedal steel chords echo through smoke-filled rooms as booming bass guitar drones and cacophonous percussion occasionally shifts into fleeting moments of steadily swinging rhythms - grasping onto form amidst abstraction.”\nOriginally self-released in 2020 by New Orleans based Kelby Clark, ‘Casino’ is a self-reflective, acoustic journey, exhibiting the tender charisma of a bygone age filled with optimism and high stakes, while subsequently revealing a modern sense of sullen tension and ambiguity.\nWe believe this vital piece of southern storytelling should be available to the wider public, and thus we are elated to present the expanded re-issue of ‘Casino’, containing 2 additional pieces completed around the same time as the original work, as well as featuring new accompanying artwork.",

            "about": "A memory unspooled underwater — hushed and weightless — it slowly lifts, surfaces, refracts, then takes flight.\nDiving Wounds pair's Thme's signature restraint — soft dissonance, breath-held loops, with Virigina Aveline’s delicate fractured textures. While both, the Parisian artist Thme and the Richmond native Virginia Aveline, have had solo showings on the label prior, this is their first collaborative release as a duo. The result is an album that's continually rising towards suspended tension, all while still managing to gracefully draw you inward by carrying a revealing sense of privacy — like each note is being tended to in real time.",

            "about": "In November 2020, KMRU self-released ‘Drawing Water’. The release contained 3 supple works of porous resonance and intimate motion, giving way to a very heartfelt body of work that peers directly into the fabric of the everyday; gestures, movement, conversation, rendered graciously into waveform.\nNow, Vaagner is proud to present a special edition vinyl and cassette reissue of ‘Drawing Water’ via its A Sunken Mall imprint, with the original material spanning the first side of the record in remastered from.\nFor the second half of the record, the label has taped none other than Abul Mogard, who prepared a new piece by reworking various layers from KMRU’s original compositions.\nThis new 17 minute long piece, tilted ‘Drawing Water On Matching Teal Surfaces’, is defined by a continuously cascading and deeply resounding solemnness, which, towards the work’s concluding moments, gradually disperses through a subtle downpour of warm pads, delicately rippling through the fabric of the work, before gently dissolving into thin air.\nPRESS:\nFirst self-released in 2020, the Drawing Water tape shows KMRU working in shorter form – like Peel, his Editions Mego LP of the same year. Its exploration of sweet, rippling arpeggios, unevenly cut into soft, pattering loops, as if by hand, stands out against his usual focus on drone shapes. Notes bloom with the rhythmic logic of a likembe pulse, while the backgrounds are gently tinted with a wash of ﬁeld recording: children playing and laughing, and whispers of trafﬁc, giving each track a speciﬁc, evocative grain or grit. A new vinyl edition on imprint A Sunken Mall pairs Kamaru’s originals with a long piece by Abul Mogard using all three as source material.\nRendering Kamaru’s music box chimes into his own signature granular murk, sweeping across the sound ﬁeld like folds of rain, and unfolding across nearly twenty minutes, Mogard ironically pushes Drawing Water closer towards the current trend of Kamaru’s sound: towards longer explorations of the space where ambient becomes noise, and stillness becomes a form of mental travel.\n-Sam Davies, The Wire\nBerlin's Vaagner imprint reissues KMRU's intimate 2020 self-release 'Drawing Water', adding a 17-minute rework of all three tracks from Abul Mogard.\nBerlin-based Kenyan sound artist KMRU let his heart sing a little louder on 'Drawing Water', one of the most unbound, melodic releases he's put into the world. The three tracks are markedly different from his best-known material, eschewing field recordings and lengthy passages of chilly ambience in favor of bubbling sine patterns and off-kilter lullabies. It sounds as if he was inspired by the neo-Kankyo Ongaku of Japanese architect H. Takahashi, but in KMRU's hands the formula takes on a more emotional resonance. With just three short tracks, he creates a mood that's effortlessly playful, but completely tranquil, like an orchestra of tired robots playing tiny toy synthesizers at the side of a lake.\nExpectedly, Abul Mogard's response to the material darkens the mood considerably. The formerly anonymous Italian composer brings an immediate solemnity to KMRU's mellow sketches, adding processed piano tones and breathy, low vibrational ambience and letting the original sounds only just poke out from beneath the murk. As the piece progresses into its final third, Mogard obscures his sounds even further, adding layers of distortion and eerie drones that reframe KMRU's music completely. With Mogard at the dials, KMRU's lullabies sound sad, restless and unsettling, like nervous, hungry ghosts.\n-Boomkat\n(German)\nDas erste Pandemiejahr markierte den Durchbruch von Joseph Kamaru. Sein spontan aufgenommenes Album »Peel« war in einem Jahr, in dem alle noch fix eine Ambient-Platte aufnahmen, weil das gerade Sinn ergab, eines der großen Jahres-Highlights. Es war in diesen zwölf Monaten jedoch (bei weitem) nicht das einzige Release des mittlerweile nach Berlin übergesiedelten Klangkünstlers. »Drawing Water« wurde im November 2020 zum Bandcamp Friday nachgereicht und umfasste drei vergleichsweise kurze Stücke, die perfekt in die Herbststimmung eines verkorksten Jahres passten.\nDas Titelstück überzog eine Etüde in Sachen Kankyō Ongaku – slicke Synthie-Klänge in der Tradition eines Yoshimura Hiroshis oder jüngeren Projekten wie Atoris – mit viel Rauschen und ließ Kinderstimmen durch den Mix geistern. »Matching Teal Surfaces« nutzt dieselben klanglichen Beigaben, stellt aber in blubbernd-pulsierende Melodien ins Zentrum, die sich im Geiste der Minimal Music zu stetig in Bewegung befindlichen Rhythmen verzahnen. »Uneven« markiert schon den Schlusspunkt dieser wohligen EP und tut das mit tastenden Tönen, die KMRU durch die verschiedenen Ebenen des Mixes laufen lässt – eine Art schwere- und beatlose IDM-Interpretation mit viel Tape-Saturation.\nFür die auf Vinyl erscheinende Neuauflage dieses kurzen Vergnügens über sein Imprint A Sunken Mall stellt das Label VAAGNER dem noch eine 17-minütige Komposition von Altmeister Abul Mogard nebenan, für welche sich dieser bei den drei Stücken bedient. »Drawing Water On Matching Teal Surfaces« ist weitaus elegischer: Er lässt einzelne Töne wie in einem Orgel-Requiem miteinander schwingen und schlussendlich in dräuenden Drones miteinander verschwimmen. Das ist die perfekte Ergänzung und zugleich ein stimmungsvoller Kontrapunkt zu den schönen Vignetten von KMRU.\n-Kristoffer Cornils, HHV Mag\nRauschen, Pluckern, Flirren: Der multidisziplinäre Künstler KMRU stellt mit „Drawing Water“ eine Klangwand zur Disposition, die so brüchig wie widerstandsfähig ist.\nWirklich neu ist die Musik nicht. Doch was macht das schon?! Immerhin sind die drei ursprünglichen Stücke und die – dann doch neue –Bearbeitung von Abul Mogard vor wenigen Tagen erstmals „richtig“ veröffentlicht worden: auf LP und Tape beim Berliner Label Vaagner, bzw. dessen Sub-Label A Sunken Mall. Joseph Kamaru – KMRU – stammt aus Nairobi, lebt aber schon lange in Berlin. Der Klangkünstler hat sich u.a. auf Field Recordings fokussiert, von denen man jedoch auf „Drawing Water“ wenig hört, zumindest nicht im prägnanten Vordergrund.\nStattdessen ist Kamarus Ansatz für dieses Album pure elektronische beauty mit jeder Menge Melancholie. Die drei Tracks – „Drawing Water“, „Matching Teal Surfaces“ und „Uneven“ – sind Ambient in der klassischsten Definition des Begriffs. Mich erinnert der Beginn des Titeltracks in seinem komprimierten Rauschen an Deru und dessen Album „1979“, was mich bereits in den ersten Sekunden zum absoluten Fanboy Kamarus Musik macht. Immer wieder stolperte ich in der Vergangenheit über den einen oder anderen Track von ihm, schaute mir Videos an, in denen seine Arbeit dokumentiert wurde, und freute mich darüber, dass das Ballertechno-Streaming-Format Hör tatsächlich auch mehr kuratiert als 4/4.\nAuf „Drawing Water“ geht es also um Sound. Um minimal arrangierte Fingerübungen, in denen die Kreativität des Komponisten auf das Innenleben der Maschinen, vor allem aber deren Drang zum Rhythmischen trifft. Eine ganze Armada von Arpeggios jongliert in unterschiedlichsten Tempi und Ansätzen mit den Klängen und Ideen von Kamaru. Mal ganz subtil im tieffrequenten Bass, mal viel offenkundiger in den Melodien. Wer mich ein wenig kennt, weiß, wie sehr ich diesen Groove aus alten Maschinen liebe, dabei spielt das Genre eigentlich gar keine Rolle. Arpeggios machen Druck, liefern Substanz, Orientierung oder Unterbau für was auch immer sich „oben“ abspielen mag. „Drawing Water“ ist perfekt. Hat trotz aller Stille und Zurückhaltung immer einen richtungsgebenden Puls, versinkt also nie in der Belanglosigkeit, die Ambient manchmal eben mit sich bringt, jedoch nie mit sich bringen muss. Aber: schillernde Presets sind oft einfach zu verlockend.\nDie drei Tracks kommen direkt aus dem Herzen, haben Dringlichkeit. Changieren in epischer Vorsicht zwischen verschleierter Emotion, latent gebremster Euphorie für Klarheit und einer offenkundigen Faszination für alles, was rauscht, ein wenig kaputt scheint. So entsteht Größe. Die Tracks sind Berge der Sicherheit.\nFür die Neuauflage, bzw. Erstveröffentlichung, steuert Abul Mogard – der Italiener Guido Zen – eine Art Megamix der drei Tracks bei. Mit „Drawing Water On Matching Teal Surfaces“ nähert sich der Producer den brüchigen Entwürfen Kamarus respektvoll und dennoch offen. Das sind deepe 17 Minuten. Passen perfekt zu der Deepness der Originale. Eine der besten Platten 2023.\n-Thaddeus Herrmann, Das Filter",

            "about": "In the past few years, Clarice Jensen has forged her own path. Recently, her focus has shifted to film scoring, successfully recording work for three feature films between 2020 and 2021. At the same time, Clarice continues to serve as artistic director of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble, while continually collaborating with an impressive array of musicians, such as Max Richter, Björk and Stars of the Lid, to name a few.\nThat being said, it was her 2019 tape release on Geographic North, Drone Studies, that initially caught the attention of a wider audience, with the work showcasing a compelling assembly of deeply immersive drones, and elegantly orchestrated compositions, in which neoclassical elements collide with electric density.\nThree years later, the work has lost none of its innovative character and appeal. It also documents a turning point in Clarice's career, one where her classically trained background started to converged and overlap with her interests in improvisational electronics and drone music. As a result, the aptly titled Drone Studies shows Clarice at her most exploratory, introspective, and daring, channeling her areas of interest into a collage of richly textured timbers, and cello movements of sublime tension.\nNow for the first time, the original album can be experienced through an expanded vinyl reissue, mastered by Rafael Anton Irissari, and carefully adjusted for vinyl by Ian Hawgood. The new reissue also features an additional track by Clarice called Platonic Solids 2, which was originally conceived around the same time as Drone Studies, and which has now been made available exclusively for the vinyl edition and on the Vaagner Bandcamp.\nWe hope that this new reissue will aid in introducing Clarice's groundbreaking Drone Studies to a new crowd of listeners through this expanded edition.\n----\nOriginal press text from Geographic North, 2019:\nClarice Jensen is a composer and cellist based in Brooklyn, NYC. As a versatile collaborator, Jensen has recorded and performed with Jóhann Jóhannsson, Stars of the Lid, Owen Pallett, Max Richter and numerous others. As the artistic director of ACME (the American Contemporary Music Ensemble), brought to life some of the most cherished works of modern classical music, including pieces by Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Gavin Bryars, Dustin O’Halloran, and more.\nJensen now follows her debut album 'For This From That Will Be Filled' with 'Drone Studies,' highlighting Jensen’s improvisational prowess, venturing even deeper into the meditative mire but with more organic, naturally expressive air.\n“The Organ that Made You Bleed” presents a succinctly striking suite that opens in medias res, awakening in a howling chorus of disembodied tones. This tragic ocean of estranged sound ebbs and flows, almost unnoticeable growing in a swell of hymnal hysteria. The calmly chaotic frenzy soon gives way into a layered composite of deep drones and tidal textures. Hopeful harmonies clash with eerie dissonance, suggesting the deeply human balance between darkness and lightness. It’s a magnum opus told in a sequence sketches, and each new turn is a cavern of radiant resonance.\n'One Bee' perfectly foils the A-side with an insomniatic interplay of pure tones and richly repetitive cello phrases. The piece begins as a blank canvas, simultaneously empty and brimming with potential. One by one, solitary tones reveal themselves in the foreground until forming a small choir of complementary combinations. This beautifully odd ritual plays out in slow motion as Jensen’s cello performs a tight loop of emotionally expressive notes.\nTaken as a whole, 'Drone Studies' a harrowing set of deep listening that uncovers new gifts with each repeated listen.",

            "about": "Initially self-released digitally earlier this year, Ruben Kotkampʼs debut album ‘fall/winter 19ʼ20ʼ showcased the Netherlands based artists prowess at crafting a musical world entirely his own, enveloped by a fabric of electronic blips, glitches and clamour. Yet under this soundscape of synthetic networks lies a poignant human component that underpins the inherent moving quality of the work, which when viewed in its entirety comes across as a meditation on the digital ages continually intersecting framework between man and machine, voice and sound, body and fabric.\nFor this expanded issue, Vaknar presents the original album in physical format for the first time, while including two new pieces that further expand upon themes found in the original work, such as a new composition by Ruben Kotkamp, which interlaces some of the albums components into a 12 minute barrage of static noise and modulated voice experiments.\nAdditionally the expanded album includes a rework by Belgian composer Mathieu Serruys, who likewise reworks various components from the album and moulds them into a 9 minute long, heavily tape processed soundscape of clattering hiss, droning horns and tempered voices, ending the album on a final swan song of deteriorating machinery and human impermanence.",

            "about": "Feelings was written and produced by Ekin Fil amidst the months of anxious tension that 2020 laid upon us, taking around 1 year to manifest in its final form.\nYet underneath the opaque veneer of swooning drones, timeworn chords and verbal lamentations, glimpses of sanguinity and optimism flicker through the fabric of the work, mirroring the perpetual state of uncertainty and isolation we collectively faced that year, suspended between months of dissolute ambivalence and minute, optimistic spurs.\nPRESS:\nFollowing an impressive run of releases for Helen Scarsdale Agency and Students of Decay, Ekin Fil's latest album is an exercise in emotional catharsis. Her soft vocals are the album's anchor, and add a beam of optimistic humanity through the thick fog of doom. On 'Little One', he voice cuts through piano and sounds like a lost Cocteau Twins demo, while on 'Infinite Space', it's almost reduced to a ghostly whisper, struggling to be heard beneath the sound of rain.\nThe album's most successful moment is the title track, a collaboration with Bulgarian artist Krāllār. Here, Fil's voice is blown out into psychedelic harmonic prisms that swirl through slow-moving frozen soundscapes. The piano is still there, but re-sculpted into warped icicles - it's disarmingly beautiful.\n-Boomkat\nThe experience of listening to Ekin Fil’s stunning new album, Feelings, is like the momentary blindness experienced leaving someplace dark and walking out into the daylight. Everything goes white; a pensive stillness takes over, time becomes momentarily infinite. Feelings is stuck there, rife with anxiety and longing, but also grounded with a stoic determination to not shield our eyes from the blaze.\nEkin Fil has been making beautiful, haunting albums for over a decade now, but the quiet intensity of Feelings is overwhelming. Rain drenches lolling piano chords on the sinuous reflections of “Infinite Space.” Ekin Fil’s voice sits in a spherical chamber circumventing the creeping glow. Clouds obscure the sun, but just barely; echoes escape into the sky and disappear. “Never Seen” treads similar waters, but from the other side. Somber passages begin sinking toward the core, the vocals like a sodden net dragging everything toward the abyss. This push/pull sentiment slinks throughout Feelings.\nThroughout Feelings, Ekin Fil’s piano playing is the guidepost. It’s the backbone on pieces like “Little One” and “A Veil,” creating structures that she layers with gauzy ephemera. The languid float of synth flares and vocals encases the firm edges with a steely resolve. “Signals” repeats in slow circles permeated with a winter chill, tiptoeing across the awakening landscape. As her voice flickers over an ocean of stars across a dark blue backdrop, the nightblooms open and sing.\nFeelings is a strange, enchanting environment. We’ve all visited places that were unforgettable, even if we never wanted to return or see them again. Constructed in the shattering mire of 2020, Feelings is in that zone, but hearing it head on and dissecting the arcane messages woven throughout are the surest ways out of the fire.\nBrad Rose, Foxy Digitalis",

            "about": "A work of acute sincerity and an ode to spiritual survival, with ‘Gli Spiriti Della Marca’, Italian artist Carlo Giustini delivers his most earnest outing to date, comprised of four sonic meditations that were created in isolation during the height of the Covid-19 crisis in Treviso, Italy.\nBy only using a rudimentary set of instruments and recording techniques, Giustini was able to channel a sense of timeworn yet reconciling familiarity through his work, interweaving bleached tape loops with the wistful sounds of unperturbed domestic life.\nPoem titled 'Gli Spiriti Della Marca' by Carlo Giustini\nTranslated from Italian to English by O.R\nMarch 29, 2020\nReality fell into a slumber,  upon waking, it stumbled loudly.\nThe old, familiar voice of dust returned to sing.\nThese are days suspended in time, suspended in smoke.\nA reverie, an acquainted painting, worn and creased by the whistle of our factories.\nWe found ourselves confined in a thought, entombed in a home.\nTraditions, the ancient ones, they still give us comfort.\nLike spectres we wander in our houses, indefinitely at ease.",

            "about": "Selected Press:\nAround the ancient city of Istanbul, a defensive wall dating back to classical antiquity sits embedded in a landscape that has been a crossroads of civilisation for thousands of years. Over time, the forces of erosion have softened its hard edges, rounding its once imposing form into heaps of crumbling ruins. In some places, the wall has been rebuilt using a patchwork of old and new bricks; in other places, it has worn away altogether, conquered by the persistent efforts of wind and sea and summer weeds.\nLike the ruins of an ancient wall, the music of Turkish composer Ekin Üzeltüzenci stands as a soft reminder that hard boundaries are a fleeting illusion.\nHeavy is a welcome LP reissue of a tape released in 2016 on the No Kings label, one of Üzeltüzenci’s most compelling albums to date.\nOpener “Aeter” features her signature instrumentation: mumbling piano, gently rolling guitar and a wisp of vocals refracted through a grey cloud of reverb. On “Still Numbers” layers of gentle hiss and warm static envelop the melody like a cocoon.\nAs the album progresses, the shapes become looser, adorned by spirals of delay spooling ever deeper into a haze of memory. “Gogo” moves like the ghost of a pop song, buried under time. “Stranger” represents Ekin Fil’s mood conjuring at its finest – a disorienting blur of ASMR-inducing whispers disappearing into a delicate cascade of swirling smoke.\n-Emily Pothast for The Wire\nArriving in the midnight wake of ‘You, Only’, Ekin returns with a reissue of a long sold-out tape for No Kings. ‘Heavy’ is perhaps a knowing misnomer for the album’s gauzy, elusive atmospheric qualities, but does suit its emotive heft perfectly. In seven parts she speaks to lonely, isolationist moods discreetly yet directly, typically using reverb and a web of SFX to render her voice and music like a massive, woollen shroud or comfort blanket of sound weft from glossolalic gild and charged air.\nHighly Recommended.\n-Boomkat\nAbout the Release:\n'Heavy' was originally produced 5 years ago and released in 2016 on tape via Lee Noble's seminal No Kings label.\nNow the work has been reissued on vinyl and remastered from the original tape rips by Rashad Backer, preserving the fragile and heavy hearted auditory sensibility found in the original work, while making one of Ekinʼs earliest and most personally endearing releases available to a new audience of listeners.",

            "about": "“The darkness does not lift but becomes yet heavier as I think how little we can hold in mind, how everything is constantly lapsing into oblivion with every extinguished life, how the world is, as it were, draining itself, in that the history of countless places and objects which themselves have no power of memory is never heard, never described or passed on.”\n― W.G. Sebald, Austerlitz\nPRESS:\nShrouded in clouds of reverb, Appropriate Savagery’s 2nd Vaknar album embeds a brooding sort of romantic sci-fi thriller narrative\nFollowing from 2020’s ‘The Same Demons Drawn on a Crumpled Piece of Paper’, David Lacroix’s next album on Vaknar - label behind releases from Kevin Drumm, Perila & Ulla, Celer - also heads in pursuit of a pulpy, elusive narrative muse evoked thru its melancholy melodic drift and suggestive song titles. There’s a sort of misty Tokyo at night soundtrack quality to proceedings, perfusing half-heard vocals and drizzly atmospheres between the sleepy dreamy qualities of ‘Fingers Crossed, Blank Page & Loaded Rifle’ and elegiac curtain closer ‘And Yet, You’ll Hear The Nicest Things About Him’, following a shadowy silhouette of a protagonist between the mournful keys of ‘Invisible, In Plain Sight (Part I-II)’ to noirish scenes on ‘’Just For a Few Hours (February 28, 2021 Overdose)’ and Bladerunner-esque ‘On Forever Barren Lands, We Shall Find Salvation Together’, and a passage of reverberating industrial ambient, ‘This Curved Bronze Medallion On Her Salty Lips.’\n-BOOMKAT",

            "about": "Under his moniker ‘Blessed are the Hearts that Bendʼ, filmmaker and artist Luke Seomore channels his narrative abilities and experiences into musical output. ‘Is My Destroyerʼ, his latest album, is an ode to film, legacies and trauma.\nOn the album, Luke showcases meticulously sculpted compositions that range from solemn ambient soundscapes to orchestral symphonies, often featuring spoken word or field recordings, while being permeated by a rich sense of cinematic atmosphere. ʼIs My Destroyerʼ unfolds like a story arc, always filled with a sense of time and direction as ideas morph, grow, disperse and rekindle; with key pieces like ‘Palaceʼ these ideas seem unbound, bursting out of their seams with emotional grandeur, elegance and passion, while other works such as ‘Orioʼ or ‘The Towerʼ offer sincere moments of reprieve.\nIn the end, ‘Is My Destroyerʼ feels like a film without pictures, enticing listeners to fill the void with their own imaginings as they experience this moving body of work, leaving one with both a shared sense of connectivity and a singular experience, which ties in to the core theme of the work, one where Luke questions how experiences, legends, ideas and trauma get passed on through generations.",

            "about": "Andrew Hargreaves, a master of pensive sonic tempers, debuts on Vaknar via his admired Tape Loop Orchestra alias, presenting two delicately brittle soundtracks of caustic strings tucked under a layer of eroded choral humming, fragmented synths and sonorous reverb.\nPRESS:\nTimeless drone romantic Andrew Hargreaves (The Mistys, The Boats) debuts his Tape Loop Orchestra on Berlin’s Vaknar with a high tog blanket of willowing strings weft into vaporous choral harmony and edged with a bittersweet fragility.\n‘Magnetically Yours’ follows the constants of decay, melancholic ennui, and interzone exploration that have earned him a cult following over the 20 years since he emerged in duo The Boats with Craig Tattersall. A thread of high moors isolationism and Lancastrian modesty links all of Hargreaves’ projects and is manifest most beautifully across this half hour work, where his signature feel for dewy atmospheric clag and plasmic apparitions comes to life in its transition from quivering choral voices and distant bass to echoes of The Caretaker’s eerie nostalgia, quiet-loud post rock inference, and blissed ambient keys.\nIn the music’s patient, tactful unravelling, Hargreaves’ quietly romantic pathos bleeds thru in spidery webs of melody and detuned oscillator tones that disintegrate in mid-air, creating a discrete veil of enigma that suggests it’s all best received solo under low light conditions. The effect evokes sensations of detachment as much as yearning, as though viewing a city’s bright lights from its meridian, or even inside it, but still in one’s own world. As with much of his stuff, it’s haunted and haunting stuff, implying a metaphysical porousness and between worlds mindframe that’s understood once felt and best uses his chosen medium as the portal to altered states of consciousness, but without getting all new age about it.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "Functioning as a companion release to 7.37/2.11, the A side from Memories of Log consists of two pieces Perila composed together with fellow friend and artist Ulla during the same period that the 7.37/2.11 LP took form. While on the B side, Ulla showcases an emotive and sub-heavy solo piece for the ages.\nPress:\nAmbient space dust from Perila & Ulla, yielding gems referencing their ‘LOG ET3RNAL’ album of 2020.\nWith two of contemporary ambient’s most keenly observed operators on hand, the results are reliably sublime and blessed with a sort of gauzy, daydream appeal familiar to their respective aesthetics. It’s a real pleasure to spend time with these three cuts, oozing with warmth and a rustling pathos from the tender pads and recorded domesticity in ‘Every Something Is an Echo of Nothing’, to more frayed, Jelinekian textures and baubled chords in ‘Room to Room’, before Ulla wanders off solo into the slumbering, pillowy subbass and inner city sferics of ‘Falling Water Lullaby.’\n-Boomkat\n---\nPerila and Ulla are undeniably the First Ladies of modern ambient, having spearheaded a new textured complexity in the genre. Using advances in sound design and recording they create songs from the murky to the sublime, layered with ASMR-type mutterings and whimsical snippets of field recordings, both as solo artists and collaborators.\nMuch of Perila’s output references memories and subtleties of life such as ‘i had a dream i don’t remember’ and ‘message from another table.’ She first came to my attention with her fantastic album on Manchester based Sferic, 'Irer Dent'. Her output is often a little unsettling, yet with a certain fragility, as if the songs might snap at any moment.\nUlla formerly known as Ulla Straus is the same but different, known for her glacial guitar-based soundscapes, punctuated with delicate sound collage and fleeting ASMR murmurings. In 2019, Ulla’s collaborations with Pontiac Streator on West Mineral brought her into the public eye. Further ties with New York based label Motion Ward saw the release of an album ‘Limited Frame’ this year.\nPerila and Ulla’s last collaborative EP was 2020's 'LOG ET3RNAL' and judging by the title, 'Memories of Log' is possibly the offcuts and reminisce on the former.\nStarting in true Perila/Ulla style with scratching over the surface of a sublime melody, ‘Every Something is an Echo of Nothing’ begins, ever so slightly unnerving. Then the song stops. And starts. And stops again, each time the overlying organic sounds disappear, as the melody comes back in, stronger.\nThis odd use of staccato (if we can call it that) actually occurs often enough to make me check the headphones a few times to see if they’ve broken. They’ve not. They say silence speaks louder than [words]. Looking at the title of the song, it all becomes clear. We’ve got somethings, and nothings.\nHead onto the second track via glitchy ASMR akin to what I can only describe as an otherworldly being moving from room to room. Imagine it searching, crackling, heading in and fumbling through the contents, only to forget the reason for its visit. Accompanied by a broken piano clunking in the background: an unlikely duet of protagonist and environment. The protagonist being the alien-esque mumblings, the environment as the clunky keyboard moving from one phase to the next, moving in unison from ‘Room to Room.’\n“Relax...” say the sub-heavy synths as they guide us to the finale on the flip-side. The subs creep down the dark, winding road with twinkling overtures as headlights. It’s all about enjoying the journey with Ulla’s solo closing track, which fades out to a blinking finale to see off the never-ending trip.\nTaking into account the title ‘Falling Water Lullaby,’ it’s likely that the artist interpreted the song as a waterfall with sparkling droplets, heading downstream. Give it a go yourself. Maybe we’ll have a vote; falling water vs nighttime drive?\nAn EP which stays true to its former incarnation of 'LOG ET3RNAL', relaxing upon a first listen and becoming more complex with every subsequent outing. Recommended to put on as a loop, as background music or for contemplating deep life choices.\n- Kim Kahan, Inverted Audio",

            "about": "Minor Blossoms is a collection of ambient vignettes, crafted to evoke and nurture inner emergence. Through analog processing and re-amping, Anton Friisgaard conjures nine sonorous petals, guiding listeners into a state of contemplative emergence.\nThe music is made using reel to reel tape machines, acoustic piano, digital audio editing and granular sampling. Gradually created in process of continuous resampling, processing and recomposing acoustic recordings into. Acoustic sound was fed into analogue and digital processing chains, and from there, alternated shapes and emerged. These shapes, forms and timbres have then been composed into the music of Minor Blossoms.\n“I've always gravitated towards an inner state where thoughts and emotions blossom on their own – a realm of connections and experiences, hidden beneath the psychological surface of daily life. This state provides a profound connection with what is stored in the spiritual realm. I want this album to be the soundtrack for that inner journey.”\n-Anton Friisgaard",

            "about": "Kevin Drumm’s Neither Here Nor There is a boundless, unrelenting exploration of liminal, untethered drone compositions that sit somewhere between presence and absence. Over the course of over 2 hours, intricate micro-shifts in tonal texture unfold into an unceasing, nearly oppressive, contemplative limbo.\nCompiled and released via Vaagner both digitally in remastered form and as a special triple cassette edition on its Vaknar sister label, the expansive set highlights some of Drumm’s most dense, meditative and wholly captivating drone work, all of which was produced and self-released during a short yet fruitful tenure between 2018 and 2019.\nPredominantly known and acclaimed for his noise work, what’s immediately becomes striking about Neither Here Nor There is its commitment to minimalism—not in the conventional sense, but as a focused intensity that explores the boundaries of what (drone) music can achieve, fluctuating at times between endurance test and religious experience, where sustained movements with intricate textural variations and minute adjustments take on almost revelatory properties through the consistency of Drumm’s vision.\nIn the end, there’s an undeniable quality of ritual to this release, an exploration of the existential space between being and nothingness, with Neither here nor there perfectly encapsulating this unmoored condition, leaving us, the listener in an ever oscillating state of quiet tension and sublime dissonance.\nPRESS:\nAssembling six side-long drone experiments that Drumm self-released between 2018 and 2019, 'Neither Here Nor There' is essential listening for anyone that enjoyed his epochal 'Imperial Distortion' and 'Imperial Horizon' sets.\nStill best known for his ear-bleed noise tomes like 'Sheer Hellish Miasma', Drumm's long-form tonal experiments are just as captivating, but raking thru his Bandcamp catalog can be intimidating. Thankfully, Berlin's Vaagner imprint has done some of the heavy lifting and extracted some of the Chicago mainstay's most hypnotic latter-day meditations. 'Horizontal', the third long segment of Drumm's 2018 album of the same name ushers us in, and it's not just the title that gestures towards 2009's sustained tone experiment 'Imperial Horizon'. Playing blurry, slightly fluctuating tones against each other, Drumm creates tension with the lightest variations - he doesn't need volume to keep us enchanted.\nThere's even less obvious movement in 'Later', the closing track from 2018's 'The March Flog', but the spectacle comes from the tiny vibrations and resonances. The closer you listen, the more the rhythms vibrate to the surface, and a single drone turns into a chorus of beating pulses. 'Gaslight Bill', an edited version of Drumm's 45-minute 'THE GAS BILL EP', finds the artist at his most celestial, while 'More (Part 1 and 2)' and 'More (Part 4)' (three quarters of 2019's 'More (Sunday Stuff)', dims the lights a little, balancing imposing organ-like drones with unsettling low-end ambience.\n-Boomkat",

            "credits": "released May 7, 2021\nWhat began with the ‘Surging Wavesʼ compilation in 2018, now finds its closing pendant in ‘Receding Tidesʼ, which highlights a set of compositions by Japanese based ambient veterans Corey Fuller, Hakobune, Rhucle and Marty Hicks, as well as Yuto Ohashi, who has furtively been releasing exceptional ambient works since 2015.\nThe initial installation in the series, ‘Surging Wavesʼ teemed with a sense of both, jubilant optimism and foreboding skepticism, and the mood on ‘Receding Tidesʼ takes on a similar note, as three years later Japanʼs ambient music scene continues to face an uncertain future, and with issues further heightened by the corona pandemic.\nEach piece on ‘Receding Tidesʼ engulf the listener with a feeling of serenity, poise and contemplation, with the mood ruminating deeper into an emotionally introspective plain as one reaches the compilations final segment.\nIn the end, one of ambient musics great strengths lies in its remedial potential, and especially during these times of adversity, ‘Receding Tidesʼ is a true testament as to how music can set our minds free.",

            "about": "J.Carter - Rejoice\nA Sunken Mall 01\nThe story of the Southerner who leaves the South will forever carry with it a certain poetic solemnity, as though the mystic doom of Faulkner, and his Yoknapatawpha County, follows them elsewhere, follows them everywhere. The cruelty of the Countryʼs history is embedded in their every move, their every utterance, their voice itself. One need only to sit with Rejoice!, the new album from Brooklyn-by-way-of-Nashville artist Jeremiah Carter, once, to comprehend the significance of such antiquities and their reflections both on self and world alike.\nThe cinematic samples of stringed instruments on the opening Title Track, along with a great deal of the A-Side, paints a thousand overlapping landscapes, of plains, of prairies, of mountains. They clash at times, in prickling discord, like dragonflies disturbed in their hovering atop endless fields of cattails. But, at others, they mingle with Carterʼs gorgeous, lush synthesizers, graciously oozing a fullness both enriching and wholly melancholy. These tracks are simultaneously irksome and soothing, the A-Side echoing holograms of a similarly sad theme throughout—taking its time with us, for the benefit of our own self-reflection. The incorporation of the spoken word of Roberto Bolañoʼs “43. Like A Waltz,” on the track of the same name, humbly nods to timeless and scenic summers, or not summers—a beautiful forgetmenot.\nStatic and droning highs overtake the air on Side B, like a rainforest mist, the synths returning as sunbeams through the treetops. It becomes all the more warming and loving than its preamble. The glowing tones of “Perfectly Red Ochre,” and “Abandonment Veil,” beckon us away form the previous perils of dissonance. They hover like the haze after a much needed rainfall, as if to say, “See? this land is not doomed.” Organic instrumentation interrupts the drones on this Side—solitary acoustic guitar on “Over Your Cities,” and piano on closing track, “Silence Belongs To Us.” Itʼs Carterʼs reminder that a human voice lay behind all this, that someone is playing these instruments, composing these epics. By its end, Rejoice! has done what historians will forever aim, yet consistently fail, to do—it captures the soul of a land. It channels Carterʼs voyage from Southern States to Northern, with the conflicts of his past, and the landʼs, trailing behind him like a cape. He wears these sounds, and he wears them beautifully.\n-JP Basileo",

            "about": "\"All things that have form eventually decay.\"\nAfter last year's tenuous offering \"Another Fall,\" Craig Tattersall (A Humble Bee) returns with a new collaborator in tow, Erik Williamson. Together the duo unveil a body of collaborative work titled 'remnants', showcasing a near hour-long offering of unfaltering melancholy, with each piece engulfing the listener in an abyss of tape-laden hiss, while drifting ever so slightly into aimless reverie.",

            "about": "Whisky soaked, nocturnal, brooding. Aging’s album ‘Troubles? I Got A Bartender’ was a noteworthy, film-noir infused suite that quietly slipped out on cassette in 2015 by a then budding Manchester avant-jazz ensemble, led by David McLean.\nIn 2020, amidst the pandemic’s tempest and winter's gloom, the idea manifested of showcasing McLean’s slow burning, wistful soirée in a new light via a curated effort by Berlin’s Vaagner label, which invited a series of hand-picked artist to rework selected compositions from the album, rendering its mournful, smoke-tinged resonances into new shapes.\nIts result, simply titled ‘Rewoven’, presents 6 new interpretations by 5 artists. These range from ruminating, tape smudged ambient works interlaced with sublime acoustic strums by fellow Manchester musicians The Humble Bee and Tape Loop Orchestra, to poignant steel guitar renditions by Nashville based Kelby Clark. Furthermore, Barcelona based Dania and London based Laila Sakini, each present pieces that draw the listener into opaque realms harbored by swooning reverie and eerie, glistening prophecy.\nCarefully assembled across two sides of vinyl, McLean’s penchant for hard-boiled detective novels, vintage Japanese crime flicks and film noir iconography have a continued lurking presence in the reworks, yet the new pieces each add a modern facet to the original’s cinematic narrative, its morose and sulky mood now opening into new avenues of interpretation. And whilst some artists have chosen to dive further into the themes of contentious ambivalence and pensive solitude, others have sought to slightly lift the haze, stirring up melodies tinged with a sense of hope, hinting at times, towards instants of poise and vivacity.\nIn the end this leaves us with a new body of work that manages to feel poignant in its complexity whilst remaining dissonant and elusive in its renditions, hinting at a modern day existence even more opaque, intricate and convoluted than the film noir classics of old might have pictured the world.",

            "about": "All profits go to 'Helping to Leave' & 'Kyiv Angels'\nPRESS:\n(transcribed from German, original below)\nThe release of the compilation »Setting Thoughts On Fire« on the Berlin label Vaagner, the proceeds of which go to 'Kyiv Angles' and 'Helping to Leave', does not seem unusual at first. But the six pieces come exclusively from artists who could face serious repercussions in their home country of Russia for any kind of expression of solidarity. Perhaps it's no wonder that even an artist like Perila, who otherwise works intensively with her own voice, does without vocals on her track, just as her colleagues—including Pavel Milyakov, known as Buttechno, and X.Y.R., for example—largely do without the direct and obvious, i.e. without statements. Instead, they express a basic mood with electronic soundscapes and only rarely very discreetly used rhythms. But in the course of this stringently curated compilation, the atmosphere gradually changes and ends on a lighter note. Is all of this to be understood as a kind of wordless protest? Perhaps. But it most certainly offers musical visions of a world in which it would not even be necessary.\n(original)\nBenefiz-Compilations zur Unterstützung der ukrainischen Bevölkerung sind bislang viele erschienen und erst vor Kurzem wurde auf einige von ihnen verwiesen. Fest steht allerdings auch, dass sowohl auf kurze wie auf lange Frist weiterhin jeder Cent benötigt wird. Die Veröffentlichung von »« auf dem Berliner Label Vaagner, deren Erlöse an und gehen, wirkt da zuerst nicht ungewöhnlich. Kämen die sechs Stücke nicht ausschließlich von Künstler*innen, denen in ihrem Heimatland Russland ernste Repressionen für jegliche Art der Solidaritätsbekundung drohen könnten, heißt das. Vielleicht also kein Wunder, dass selbst eine sonst sehr intensiv mit ihrer eigenen Stimme arbeitende Künstlerin wie Perila auf Vocals verzichtet einsetzt, wie auch ihre Kolleg*innen, darunter beispielsweise der als Buttechno bekannte Pavel Milyakov und X.Y.R., weitgehend auf das Direkte und Offensichtliche beziehungsweise Statements verzichten. Stattdessen bringen sie mit elektronischen Klangflächen und nur selten sehr dezent eingesetzten Rhythmen eine grundlegende Stimmung zum Ausdruck. Die wandelt sich aber im Verlauf dieser stringent kuratierten Zusammenstellung und endet mit einer lichten Note. Wortloser Protest? Vielleicht. Ganz sicher aber musikalische Entwürfe einer Welt, in der er nicht vonnöten wäre.\nKristoffer Cornils, Fieldnotes\nVAAGNER/VAKNAR assemble ambient music's great and good on this benefit compilation in aid of Ukraine. Featuring Perila, Buttechno, X.Y.R., Burago, and more.\nAlmost expectedly it's Perila who immediately impresses on this one. Yet again her syrupy production is an apt foil for all the softboi ambient that's clogging up the digital fatpipes right now. There's no weepy nostalgia here, it's all depth, passion and pure sensuality. Pavel Milyakov, aka Buttechno, also hits fertile ground with his claggy 'January'. Flickering like an old 8mm short, it refracts cooling pads over breathy electrified woodwind and squeezes out emotion like moisture from a damp sponge.\nOn 'Stealing Beauty', St. Petersburg's Vladimir Karpov (aka X.Y.R.) follows his recent releases for Not Not Fun and Good Morning Tapes with another crackly mid-point between vintage library music and swampy forest folk, while Moscow's Vtgnike concludes the compilation with the FM-blessed 'Lumturia'.\n-BOOMKAT",

            "about": "Update (April 2021):\nA year has passed since, and yet Solitary Hymns anxious tension and optimistic foresight feels as poignant now as they did then.\nNow on its anniversary and with the pandemic still ongoing, the album getʼs its first physical release, including an additional piece by Winnipeg based Adara Moreau, aka Body of Intrigue, which is exclusive to the physical version.\nOriginal Text:\nSolitary Hymns is an assemblage of ambient compositions which have been sourced and compiled by the label over the last 7 days.\nEach artist on this compilation originates from a different part of the globe, and while some of the featured works are direct, sonic responses to the occurrences of the past days, others are unreleased recordings, that take on an entirely new context in the current, unprecedented situation we all see ourselves in.\nThe compilation itself is presented in form of an aural chronical, starting with the buoyantly optimistic string arrangements of Theodore Cale Schafer's ‘Mansfield’ and the tranquil reverberations of Anthéne’s ‘Light Years’.\nSolitary Hymns then moves into a triptych of adjourning, emotionally laden tape loops from Benoît Pioulard. øjeRum and Stijn Hüwels, prompting a wave of reminiscences and reconciliation.\nMoving on, Forest Management’s piece basks the listener into an auditory shroud of heavy fog, before ‘March 28th’ by Hakubone plunges oneself into the depths of bleak, unwavering seclusion.\nOn Solitary Hymns final moments, Zen Zsigo dispenses a sonic spell, bordering between serenity and angst, before Oberlin showcases a last, musing rumination, recalling opaque windows and old charcoal dust.\n‘Solitary Hymns’ is for free, and while every donation is deeply appreciated, it is our intention that the work is accessible to anyone who might currently be looking for a brief escape from feelings of uncertainty, lonesomeness or anxiety.",

            "about": "When we can no longer move forward or look outward, some reflect and seek truth in themselves – some sharing, through the language of music, what might be impossible to say through words.\n---\nAmidst the budding tempest of 2020, Jeremiah Carter, originally hailing from Tennessee, found himself embroiled in a near suffocating air of uncertainty and anxious tension, mainly brought upon by the first spikes in a soon to be world-wide pandemic.\nOnly having recently relocated to the bustling city of New York, an unprecedented series of events took shape over the following months, isolating and alarming the city's residents in the process. It was during this time that Jeremiah fully turned his attention to music, discharging the emotional turmoil surrounding him, into newly composed work.\nBeginning with the album ‘Rejoice’, which was completed in the wake of 2020 and released on A Sunken Mall that same year, two more albums took shape in a quasi-self-induced creative tremor that materializing a wealth of work and formed a triptych of three unique albums, all produced within the span of only 6 months.\nFinally, presented here is the second part of the triptych; ‘Speak, You Also’, dedicated to Paul Celan and giving further insight into the heart of a beloved southerner, tangled in the mesh of existence, crisis and communication, far away from the prairies he once called home.\nPRESS:\nBerlin's Vaagner/Vaknar label taps Jeremiah M. Carter for the second part of his anxious triptych, another dusted ambient voyage into soft-focus acoustic instrumentation, analog synth melt and elongated drone. RIYL Celer, Forest Management, KMRU.\nLike many of us, Nashville-born Jeremiah Carter was thrown into chaos and spiraling anxiety in 2020 as the pandemic and lockdown measures ruptured the normality of his existence. But despite the uncertainty, Carter was able to find the time to dedicate himself to music, expunging his turbulent emotions as raw composition. He wrote so much material that it formed the basis of a triptych, three albums that began with \"Rejoice\", released on Opal Tapes, Vaknar and A Sunken Mall back in 2020. The second part is even stronger, a whisper-quiet hum of delicate electro-acoustic dreamweaving, hazy long-form synth sweatiness and cautious, meditative drone. There's even a nifty nod to Enya-esque vocal pop.\nEarly album tracks like the industrial 'Give it the Shade' and frothy 'Midday and Midday and Midnight' are par for the course if you're familiar with Carter's previous material, or indeed the Vaknar label. Carter's resolve is strong though and he's able to effortlessly flit from humid Steve Roach-ian new age into distorted foley-fuct drone with barely a wave of the hand. But the record really gets moving when the calm is interrupted and more personal, short-form tracks like the piano-led 'He Speaks Truly...' and moving spoken word spooker 'Now Shrinks the Place...' make themselves known. These flow into the album's standout track 'A Thread By Which...', a slow-paced micro epic that layers gorgeous vocals over cracking, negative-space electronix. Very nice.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "In his fourth solo outing for Vaknar, titled ‘Spor Af Intet, Danish composer øjeRum presents us with two cyclically reverberating long form works.\nSide A treats us to an arresting chorus of tenderly bellowing organ movements. The recording also incorporates faint trembling echoes of what seems like the touch of a pedal or the release of a key, further imbuing the work with a deeply human element.\nSide B explores a different yet equally halting movement, featuring an ambient refrain laden with both, a sense of grief and sanguinity.\nThroughout the hour long duration of both works, it is hard not to be moved by their ever repeating cycles of emotive resonance, becoming not simply meditations on movement, but on time itself.\nMastered by Ian Hawgood",

            "about": "After last year saw the launch of the Stages of Grief series via its maiden release 'Convalescence', the second volume presented here will focus on the theme of consolation and is thus aptly titled 'Solace'.\nOnce more a variety of artists were selected to respond to the theme. Solace begins with an uplifting chorus of synth laden resonances, bellowing throughout the duration of ‘Lonely Cloud’ by Danish native Rune Bagge, who made waves via his debut LP which was released on Northern Electronics last year.\nPrevious Vaknar collaborators White Stains (Belgium), Appropriate Savagery (France) and Amethyst (Germany) further divulge in a certain sonic spectrum and mood that encompasses the entire A side of the release.\nThe B side is inhabited by two contrasting compositions, starting with a piece by American composer J. Carter. Here the listener is presented with a solemn gust of layered keys which steadily develop in dramatic fashion before bursting into a hurl of feedback that over-tones the proclamations of a muffled voice.\nJ. Carter’s piece presents itself as the peak of a tumultuous phase of grievance and thus the following and final composition on the release ends on an contrastingly tranquil note, presented by Swedish composer Isorinne, who shares a nine minute long composition of pure, virtuous serenity that commemorates the arrival of a new stage, (which will be further explored throughout the third and final instalment in the series next year).\nDedicated to Isak, Lee, Roland, Jasmin, Donatien & Gabrielle",

            "about": "Each artist on ‘Surging Waves’ is in some way intertwined with the Japanese ambient music scene, one which continues to gain international appreciation abroad for its wealth of musical heritage, yet in Japan, the experimental, club and ambient music scene continues to be clouded in a slew of prohibitive legalities, with the artists themselves facing societal pressure as their artistic positions are not deemed relevant to the market economy.\nThis multifaceted blend of circumstances has led to an uncompromising wave of young, online based artists who have embedded themselves in Japan’s illusive musical sub-strata, often operating in small groups and releasing their works digitally or on tape.\nSurging Waves aims to chronicle some of these up and coming artists as they pave the way for a new era of ambient music in Japan.",

            "about": "Hailing from the small town of Debrecen, Hungary, Adam Erdei offers a tranquillising debut under his Megcsillan alias.\nThe artist chose to disclose little detail about the album itself, which is titled Ösvényről, merely revealing that it was made with a minimal set up, comprised of acoustic instruments, delay pedals and field recordings.\nÖsvényről is split into 6 parts, each piece seemingly building upon the next. It starts with gusts of foreboding reverberations, tranquil and yet static, before delicately spilling into grandiose movements, flurries of clangour, billowing tides of sonic uproar, remaining at the border between a sense of lush, overarching serenity and undulating turmoil.\nIn its final moments, Ösvényről comes across as almost epiphanic, evoking a cathartic sense of self reflection that very few albums are able to achieve.",

            "about": "PRESS:\nBilled as a sequel to 2022's '7.37/2.11', 'The air outside...' diffuses its predecessor's ambiguous synthscapes with loose-limbed slowcore improvisations, prioritising vulnerability and falibility. RIYL Laila Sakini, Grouper, Bianca Scout or Ulla.\nIf Perila's immense, immersive double album 'Intrinsic Rhythm' was too much to swallow in one sitting, this one's a little more digestible. The prolific Berlin-based assembled 'The air outside...' from sessions recorded between 2021 and 2023, but they play remarkably coherently, revealing a more fragile, serendipitous side of her personality. Made mostly using guitar and voice, it's music that's not overthought or overproduced, as if we're getting a direct line into Perila's reality - even the title betrays its unpretentious approach. On opener 'Over Me', Perila loops reversed guitar notes, picking out a rough, detuned bassline and barely singing. Her faded voice mouthes out a wordless, improvised lullaby descends into a well, reverberating as she stumbles across the notes. Not ambient exactly, it's more like evaporated, decelerated post-rock - day zero Grouper crossed with Bark Psychosis.\nAnd that description holds on 'Barefeeter', even when Perila switches to piano, playing unsteady, muted phrases as the room rattles around her. A song begins to materialize as she sings textured coos, but never completely emerges. 'Gooshy' is more surprising still, playing out like Jandek with dissonant strums that quiver around dissociated vocal expressions, and on 'Fossil', she uses the same philosophy without resorting to live instrumentation, disrupting oozed pads and whisper-singing over the horizontal soundscape.\n-Boomkat\nWord by Perila about the record:\nThis archival collection is very dear to me\nGrateful for Vaagner to release a sequel edition of memories in a physical form\nEach track feels like a door to a heavy feeling felt so clearly and processed lightly through sounds\nHere in my favourite state: talking through strings and keys, touching the instrument\nNo one feels me better then guitar\nHearing all these tracks bring sweetest nostalgia and reinforces desire to talk more and more through this mad resonance and quite acoustics as its pretty cathartic always\nSpace which has no time when you enter it.*°",

            "about": "Following his former album ‘Heirloomʼ, which came out on E. Sagglia and Death Kneelʼs now defunct Summer Isle label in 2018, ‘The Cormorantʼ is the latest album by Australian native Jason Campbell.\nAfter taking a year to complete, Campbell perceives ‘The Cormorantʼ as “a document of small-town Australia, concerned with the natural environment and the rugged coastline that I call home.”\nThe sounds of his native domain, the coastlines of New South Wales, are explored and dissected throughout the entire album, with ocean swells or conversations at the local food court are layered onto sequences of violin tremolos, detuned cymbals and delayed piano chords.\nThroughout the albums run time, ‘The Cormorantʼ inhabits a distinctive sonic realm of its own, inhabited by sounds of ocean swells or conversations at the local food court, layered onto sequences of violin tremolos, detuned cymbals and delayed piano chords. The album begins with the highly vigorous ‘Emerge Againʼ, which features an accelerative volley of machine clatter and pitch shifted choruses, slowly merging into a bed of candid breaths and piano stabs. On the midway point, The album’s title track, ‘The Cormorantʼ presents itself as the albums definite, emotive underscore, while the pre-culminating reprieve ‘A Fallen Eucalyptʼ usher in the final stages of the journey.\nIn the end, each piece on ‘The Cormorant’ showcases a unique, riveting sonic investigation into J. Campbellʼs coastal home, yet the album is not merely about an introspective examination of one's topography, it’s the culmination of a truly sincere exploration, it’s a body of work about passion, existence and self- discovery.\nPRESS:\n(...) With The Cormorant being my introduction to the musical works of J. Campbell, this album has been on high rotation in recent months. An aching melancholia permeates all aspects of this album, where field records of gentle waves, floating synths, ebbing drones, and minimal static washes blend and interweave. The occasional use of sparse piano lines, violins and vocals interject a more direct melodious focus to proceedings, which generates a quite cinematic soundtrack-styled edge. More broadly, the pacing is slow and unhurried, where the compositional elements (field recordings, sparse atonal sonic clatter, melodious synth drones, and composed/processed instrumentation), are highly detailed and balanced, while the spacious widescreen production is of enveloping warmth, rather than cold detachment.\nWhile the ambient and modern classical descriptors might be an overly dry assessment of what is sonically delivered, to this ear the overarching mood and atmosphere is strongly comparable to the dreamy ambient washes of Fennesz, as well as the more musically melancholy moments of Ben Frost’s recorded works. Yet, not wanting to be completely reductive on the basis of comparisons alone, these are mainly used to indicate the pinnacle musical level which The Cormorant inhabits. The physical edition vinyl is limited to a mere 90 copies, but also available digitally for wider distribution, particularly benefiting of an album that should be heard by a much wider audience.\n-Noise Receptor",

            "about": "“I had an unpleasant dream. I was a big black bird flying westward over a thick jungle. I was badly wounded, my feathers caked with black blood. Ominous dark clouds were gathering in the western sky, and there was a whiff of rain in the air.”\n-Haruki Murakami\nIn 2017, Amethyst decided to make a life changing decision, he moved from Germany to the great unknown - the captivating island of New Zealand.\nUpon arriving he basked in the sensations of the foreign land; the swaying of palm trees, the lush outdoors, the thunderstorms and summer showers. Yet after a few months, just as he was starting to acclimatize to his new environment, tragedy struck.\nWhat was meant to be a new beginning, became a journey of trepidation and anguish, ultimately forcing him to return home.\nBack in Germany, and after a long stint spent in recovery, Amethyst decided to filter these experiences into 8 sequential pieces, each recalling his journey from a different point in time; from preliminary optimism and acclimatisation to grave agony and in its final moments, new-found resolutions.\nIn the end, The Journey presents itself as an auditory testimony, a series of personal recollections that make up one of the most enduring and defining periods of the artist’s life, thus referring to Amethyst’s album as a personal endeavor would be a grave understatement, The Journey is Amethyst – as both, the enchantment as well as the trepidation he subsisted during his time in New Zealand continue to define him to this day, both in, and outside of music.",

            "about": "Founded by Canadian noise artist B.P in late 2012, Male Activity was a DIY record label based in Winnipeg, Canada.\nDuring its 7 year tenure the label was instrumental in documenting both local and international fringe artists associated with the global cassette scene, releasing anything from power electronics and harsh noise to industrial and ambient works.\nAfter its 100th release, Male Activity closed its doors in 2019.\nVaagner is now proud to present a chronologically arranged compilation of compositions from the labels diverse back catalogue, fully remastered and including a bonus track by B.P. himself called ‘To Concludeʼ, which is exclusively available via the cassette edition of this release.\nIt should also be noted that this is a very ambient focussed selection, and including some more noise and industrial leaning pieces would have been warranted if the goal was to showcase the breadth of the labels output, yet in this case it should be viewed as a curated attempt to bridge some connections between Male Activity's and Vaagner's history, as well as that of the neo-ambient tape scene overall.",

            "about": "2017 was a prolific year for Angelo Harmsworth, he released three solo and two split releases, one with Michigan based Dominic Coppola and one with Theodore Cale Schafer. Yet from all these substantial works one stood out in particular; ‘The Voyeurs Gambitʼ was a collection of 5 long form pieces, totalling a staggering 1 and a half hours of music, all presented in form of a usb stick that was available through Angeloʼs own Lime Lodge Imprint, which included images that accompanied the work by the artist and composer Christian Michael Filardo, who co-conceived the release.\nHowever, It was not simply the length and density of the material presented on ‘The Voyeurs Gambitʼ that made the work stand out, it was the compositions themselves; richly layered, immaculately detailed, long form sonic tapestries, all of which revealed a tonal shift that would go on to define Angeloʼs distinctive sound in the coming years, invigoratingly displayed on works such as ‘Overture Untitledʼ, on Summer Isle and ‘For Argandʼ on Vaknar, as well as other released that followed.\nSince then Angelo has moved from Santa Fe to Berlin, where he currently resides, and while his releases in recent years on Opal Tapes and Total Black have seen him further expand on his musical framework, returning to ‘The Voyeurs Gambitʼ feels like tracing back Angeloʼs distinctive and influential sound to its formative source.\nNow, 4 years later after its initial release, the entire album has been fully remastered by Angelo himself, presented on a special triple cassette edition which includes the 5 original works, as well as an additional edit by Angeloʼs longtime collaborator and friend, Theodore Cale Schafer.\nWe hope that this expanded and definitive reissue of ‘The Voyeurs Gambitʼ, will help further shed light into this unique and talented artists exceptional musical trajectory, of whom we are sure to hear more remarkable things in the near future.\nNote: Both Artist and Label have decided to present the work in cassette only format, the release will not be available digitally.",

            "about": "By reflecting on political discourse, humanity, love and passion, J. Carter lays bare an album that feels ardently personal, vulnerable and sincere.\nDrawing from various sources of inspiration that range from Japanese chamber music to spoken word, noise and folk, the album presents\nitself as an introspective journey through cultural and musical topographies that unfold vividly throughout the duration of the work.\nEars To Feed Review:\n\"If ever there could be a soundtrack to self-reflection, may it be Their Arms Surround Me Like Chains Made Of Velvet, the new album from J. Carter, out now via Vaknar Records. The Brooklyn-based experimentalist seems to specialize in stirring that which lies deepest within consciousness and sensibility, and the work on this album does so in ways that are both devastating and transformative. An unknowable history is brought forth like Proust’s madeleines, through instrumentation that is at once archaic and wholly new—not quite an acoustic guitar, but rather its memory, obscured by the ruination of adult living.\nSuch aching nostalgia whirrs past your head on opening track, “Introductory Discourse (Placing My Ailments Aside),” like jumpscares in a horror movie, the feelings of longing set to ambush at any and every turn. Spoken word, set against glowing ambience on “Contour Defined by Defenses (Apropos of the City),” elicit a reckoning between self and past selves, past relationships, past decisions. Synthesizer notes glide along linear passageways that could go on forever and offer a chance for the return of a happiness once concrete, but, as everything will, they fleet and dusk and sunken reality sets back in, grounded entirely in the melancholia of “Interpolation of Lust (Hands Outline Intent).\nThe least effected guitar samples on the album sound like a saddened troubadour playing in the corner of the abandoned bar in which you sit and ruminate. It converses with synthesizer notes prodding in the dark, echoing the Japanese exchange that plays over and through it. And everything comes to a head on closer “The Ropes Become Water As We Roll Together Towards Dawn,” with evident vocal cries submerged in glistening organ sounds that stretch on forever like buzzing glows of regret. It’s a most empathetic end to a most empathetic album. Carter sees his own humanity, and yours in these notions of nostalgia, and he writes it, hoping for at least a postcard in return, which is easily obliged by our attention given to this album, and our supervision of our feelings for its duration.\"\n- Jp Basileo\nThe Wire Review:\nThe Berlin based Vaknar label has released ten albums since its inception at the beginning of 2018. Much like the artists it supports, this subsidiary of the Vaagner imprint is couched in an intentional anonymity. It gives little away in terms of its identity beyond the signature monochrome cover art of its records and a commitment to putting out a certain neo-ambient sound that’s been cropping up around the more experimental edges of techno.\nJ Carter (aka Jeremiah Carter) is unique to the Vaknar catalogue in being based outside of traditional global ambient networks. A Nashville, Tennessee native who only relocated to New York last\nyear, Carter’s approach to what he calls “environmental music” is replete with the pathos and melancholy of the country and folk music he grew up with.\nTheir Arms Surround Me Like Chains Made Of Velvet is shadowed by a currently unreleased supplementary mix of musical influences that are superficially distinct from Carter’s gauzy electronic production. Yet somehow the power pop of Alex Chilton’s Big Star and the bittersweet Americana of John Prine’s “Summer’s End” bleed into the living, breathing organism that makes up the LP proper. The sound swells into a mnemonic landscape that’s scattered with familiar acoustic signifiers – a muted, picked string instrument on the title track or a lonely strummed guitar chord on “Concluding Silence (Hands Made of Heaven)”.\nCarter’s track titles read like book chapters, while the elements of his\nmusic – a piano, an organ, a violin – are melted down and dissolve into the rich atmospherics of a sonic architecture that is dreamlike in its lucid simplicity.\n-Steph",

            "about": "In commemoration towards the launch of 'A Sunken Mall', the new Vaagner affiliated label which will see J. Carter release his debut vinyl release, PTP main stay Dis Fig and New Mexico native Angelo Harmsworth have revisited Carterʼs previous outing, 'Their Arms Surround Me Like Chains Made of Velvet', which was released on VAKNAR last year, and prepared two remixes that each rework one piece from the album.\nDis Figʼs Rework is divided into 3 stages that take the listener from sentimental grief to indisposed reflection and rigours, purifying squalor, while Angelo Hamrsworthʼs rework is built around an ever moving and depth defying guitar stroke that, over time, expands into a tempest of bellowing machines gone haywire, all before reaching a final climax of pure, serene retrospection.\nPRESS:\nReview of 'One Another's Geography (Dis Fig's Terminal D Remix)'\nPTP-affiliate Dis Fig pays homage to the original work in offering slight alterations and vocal accompaniment. The artist’s cathartic lyricism compliments mournful piano melodies that slowly evolve into hardened drone atmospheres. Eventually, the howling top line fades into pulsating organ chords reminiscent of Kali Malone’s 2019 album The Sacrificial Code. Through partitioning Carter’s plaintive ambience, Dis Fig contemplates a longing for someone far away.\n-AQNB",

De Sosa.\nTogether they make up a release of blistering contrast, exploring sounds somewhere between insulating drones and abrasive noise steppers.\nAdditionally, the release features an alternative rendition by Appropriate Savagery, who manages to conjure a remix that encapsulates the varying sonic qualities of the entire release in one arresting composition.",

            "about": "In an age where the unyielding flow of time often overshadows the deeper resonances of our existence, Daniel Majer’s latest album, Time for No Memory, serves as an evocative meditation on the ephemeral nature of experience. Produced throughout 2023 and released in the latter half of 2024, this collection of tracks swerve through what seems like a cacophony of FM radio frequencies while oscillating between the familiar and the uncanny, leaving us with a sonic landscape that feels both timeless and retroactive yet palpably present.\nPRESS:\nWe’re really feeling this suite of hypnagogic loop chicanery and channel-hopping sampledelia, recalling Joseph Hammer via Jan Jelinek, Chuck Person, The Caretaker and Carl Stone, and produced by the canny Daniel Majer.\nOffered as a sort of mediation on displaced, non-linear flows of time in a flatland age of everything-at-once, where the timeline has become ever more elusive, ‘Time For No Memory’ hacks into perception of temporality and time-based art with a really trippy nuance. It was realised during 2023 and now arrives via Berlin’s Vaknar (Mats Erlandsson, Tape Loop Orchestra, KMRU, Kevin Drumm) with a wonderfully disjointed, evocative ebb and flow thru ten vignettes of backcombed, curled tape loops that fray and bifurcate in gently hypnotic patterns.\n‘I Dreamed a Beating Heart’ surely reminds us to a Pita classic, and ‘C Pop’ hops out of the box between what sounds like a Chinese ballad, pinging digital decays and screwed field recordings like Carl Stone cutting up a Sublime Frequency grabbed from the airwaves. The fever dream restlessness of his pop cut-up ‘Dressed’ surely conjures comparison with Jan Jelinek and Joseph Hammer’s Pan album, and the tongue-tip thizz of ‘Em’ could almost be one of Novoline’s recent pop abstractions. The relatively straight-played bit of exotica feel like it fell off a V/Vm oddity, and leads to pill-bellied sensation of ‘Divided Heart’ and by extension the proto-vaporwave of 0PN’s Chuck Person on ‘Contact’, with a waking dream-like ‘German Tacos’ that ideally signs it off and leaves one with the strangest, fleeting feels, ready to do it again.\nTIP!\n-Boomkat",

The outcomes where complied and made available via a trifling 20 self released tapes, circulated by the duo during an event in Lithuania that same year.\nSoon after, a few of the tapes showed up in the second hand market occasionally trading hands for staggering prices, yet who ever came across one of the tape rips circulating the web quickly understood what the commotion was all about; brittle noise sequences and industrial laden overtones where contrasted against perplexingly rich dub techno arrangements and uplifting ambient soundscapes. The two tape sides contained densely interwoven material which both, reflected on the duos habitual outcome while also showcasing the two explore and express a new sonic thematic that was swelling in the concurring Swedish tape scene.\nIn the end, the entire release felt like a strikingly personal glimpse into the esteemed duo’s creative minds and to this day, it remains their only released collaborative endeavour.\nNow, 3 years later, Vaagner is proud to finally present this sought after cassette release, digitally and on vinyl for the first time.\"\nMission statement:\n\"Our goal remains to share noteworthy releases from various tape communities around the globe and readdress these releases from a alternate standpoint, subsequently making them approachable to a new crowd of listeners.\nOur love for the original tapes always remain and we treat each re-issue, both visually and sonically, not as an enhancement but as a complementary augmentation of the original material, hence our re-issues will not always be exact copies of the original releases, we work together with the artist(s) and give them the space to re-approach their work in any chosen manner they see appropriate.\nIn this case the B side was chosen to be slightly edited and the Bonus track ‘Sscending’, which was conceived during the time of the original tape, was added onto the release.\"",

            "about": "I could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk and I saw the last light supine and tranquil upon tide-flats like pieces of broken mirror, then beyond them lights began in the pale clear air, trembling a little like butterflies hovering a long way off.\n- William Faulkner (The Sound and the Fury)\nVaagner is proud to present the third and final installment of Jeremiah M. Carter’s album triptych, ‘Vessels’.\nFollowing ‘Rejoice’ and ‘Speak You Also’, all three albums were conceived within a 6-month period during ferociously exalting creative sessions.\nThe Emotional turmoil of the early pandemic is as present on ‘Vessels’ as it is in the other two albums, yet the final installment showcases as more distinctive sense of focus, where the earlier albums saw Jeremiah expel a state of uncertainty and trepidation into an intense, almost spiritual form of musical cleansing, Vessels still bears those same hallmarks, yet comes across with an air of refinement and finality.\nSpanning 6 pieces, each work feels like an integral part of the album's overarching narrative, fervently nestled amid divinity and humility. By its final piece, which also clocks in as the longest in the entire triptych, we are treated to one of Jeremiah’s finest moments, and for a few seconds, it all comes together for one last swansong, forming a sonic distillation of elation and grief, desire and passion. – It’s all here.\nPRESS:\nThe third in J. Carter's album trilogy, 'Vessels' is billed as \"a sonic distillation of elation and grief, desire and passion\", mapping his mood with chiming, digital bells, dusty ambience and billowing orchestral drones.\nBrooklyn-based, Nashville-born sound artist Jeremiah M. Carter laid the anxiety and uncertainty of the pandemic on his last two albums. In contrast, 'Vessels' is a relatively cleansing experience, a way for Carter to channel the fear into spiritual focus and levity. That's all very evident on 'Vessel I (Origins of the Shells)', a calming composition that uses delicate synth bells to shuttle our minds to an uncanny sacred space without over egging the pudding.\n'Vessel II (Sparks of the Sacred)' is a dirt-rubbed slab of shadowy ambience that sounds like church music dubbed and re-dubbed to cassette tape, before it disintegrates into a showy pipe organ symphony. The lengthy 'Vessels IV-IX (Rachel)' is even more levitational, underpinning granulated strings with rousing sub bass tones and gentle choral blasts, and closing track 'Vessel X (Falling On Our Faces During the Morning Prayers)' sounds funereal, but hopeful, suggesting that another life might be on the horizon.\n-Boomkat",

            "about": "‘When The Night Ends’ is the first collaborative album from Jens Pauly and Stijin Hüwels, produced across two countries, Germany and Belgium, as Jens and Stijn completed the work via a series of online exchanges.\nRegardless of the distance between the two collaborators, Jens and Stijn seem to share a very intricate and natural bond, one that gave rise to a set of composition that seamlessly intertwine the sonic spectrum of both artists; Guitar strings, drones and field recordings effortlessly emerge, grow and disperse, as each composition introduces a new scenery of equally somber and rosy elements. This emotive interplay is a central thematic to the work and carries the album throughout its 4 long form works, resounding quietly they become the fabric of our thoughts, leaving us to ponder aimlessly, yet blissfully, amid nightfall and daybreak.",

            "about": "'You, Only' is a beguiling insight into the world of Turkish musician Ekin Üzeltüzenci and it presents her debut release on Vaknar.\nThe album features a series of musical tapestries which prominently include live instrumentation in tandem with Ekin’s own voice, all of which has been fed through a series of tape delays, giving the final outcome a brittle and reflective tone.\nPress:\nOn the new dual cassette release You, Only, both piano and voice emerge with more clarity only to crawl deeper into the soft gauze of the noise floor. On “Other Others” they are joined by the vibrato of vintage organ, and on “You, Only”, they are overtaken by a collage of field recordings and glistering synth whorls. The two long tracks of the second tape (“Scar” and “Incident Light”) reveal Üzeltüzenci slipping deeper into a more esoteric and piecemeal compositional style. Her simple, textured melodies give way to abstract forms forms that stretch and refract against a horizon line of eerie silence. Ekin Fil’s penchant for burying sounds in drones reverb and self-effacing static make these gasps of open space all the more striking. These are moments of perforation and permeability - places where the thin line between nothing and something has worn away completely\n-Emily Pothast for The Wire\nEkin Üzeltüzenci, aka Ekin Fil, is a lo-fi folk, ambient and electronica artist, hailing from Istanbul, Turkey. Upon arrival in You, Only, the listener is greeted by an adorable piano followed by jolly sweet, yet haunting female voice. Melancholic in every sense, personal, romantic, a homage to lo-fi simplicity, folkish in mentality and approach, moody, emotional and fragile. Minimal, shoegaze studies in introverted beauty. Cinematic and iconoclastic. Flowing images deep and sincere.\nSilence expressed with sound, silence with tiny sound sequences, occasionally cut by razor-sharp instrumental climaxes; a few second bursts, then a return to that wonderful, mild, sonic silence. Like waves disturbed by throwing a stone into water, fading circles with occurring colors, mostly blurred and everything covered with an ethereal web, transparent, made out of the finest fabric.\nYou, Only is a serene ambient album of extraordinary beauty, covered entirely with the veil of emotion. Six slow-paced compositions clocking to 44 minutes, that evolve and dissolve, in an abstract but structured landscape.\nInstant love, devoted electronic love and much more.\n-Karl Grümpe for Toneshift",
