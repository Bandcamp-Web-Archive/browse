            "about": "\"The productivity of the Canadian Aidan Baker , is really hard to keep up with. Baker also plays in countless group projects such as Nadja , Caudal , Adoran , ARC , Hypnodrone Ensemble , Whisper Room etc. The musical spectrum in which this multi-instrumentalist indulges is quite extensive, but mostly lies in the ambient and experimental genre with influences from rock, electronic music, classical and jazz.\nOn You Are All At Once Baker combines more song-oriented material that is interwoven with swirling ambient waves. The album has a rather minimalistic structure, mixing soft, acoustic guitar chords with abstract and repetitive melodies. Baker also shows his vocals on this piece. Unfortunately, his singing comes across as fragile and monotonous. The danger of dozing off during the delicate mumbling is of course also great.\nof atmosphere, You Are All At Once something to offer. The three slowly rippling tracks leave a soothing impression. Especially the twenty-eight minutes long All We Think We Are is a compelling listening trip with a melancholic touch. Once the sad vocals fade into the soft electronic resonances, the song blossoms into full bloom.\nBaker is You Are All At Once responsible for all instruments and effects We forgive him for his vocal experiment. The striking fine and repetitive percussion provides the barbs on this album. You Are All At Once is available on CD in a limited edition on the Bandcamp page of the American Somewherecold Records . The digital version of this album can be purchased on Baker's own Broken Spine Productions label (also on Bandcamp).\"\n~ Patsker Omaer Beguin\nluminousdash.be/reviews/aidan-baker-you-are-all-at-once-somewherecold-records/",
