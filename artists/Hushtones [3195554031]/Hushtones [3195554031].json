My family has abandoned me, I live, alone... until one day my house was abandoned, with me lying on the floor, or so I thought. Who would have thought that an accident in my own home would knock me to the ground and then not get up? I begin to forget things while I'm still there, but at the same time I remember happiness before I was here, in pain and bleeding. I think and I say to myself \"It's not worth continuing to live, I'm alone\"\nI begin to open my eyes little by little. It's my family. I manage to disillusion that I am in the hospital, but I can not distinguish their faces very well. I'm connected to some machines. I did not think the accident was so strong. I hear noises and I see spots moving everywhere until suddenly everything darkens.\nI wake up in a few hours and then I know ... I do not know where I am. It's all dark, I can not see anyone. I realize that I am abandoned. Everything is darker until I begin to remember where it was the last time I was there. It's clear, I remembered everything.\nThe accident left me very bad.\nI'm dead.\nI love them, I miss them.\nGoodbye.",

Despite being an overall relaxing listen, 'before we appear' makes you feel itchy as victory over death does a great job experimenting with sound textures.\"",

            "about": "For quite some time now, and by this I mean months ago, I wanted to start a side project where I could release Ambient and Dark Ambient. The latter doesn't mean I couldn't do it on Mabisyo, but from now on everything I do on Hush Bisyo is something with a different approach, much more experimental.\nI want to have the freedom to play with sounds and effects without filling up my main project (Mabisyo) which is already full of albums. I also want to be able to give space to genres like Hushwave, Drone and other genres that are simply part of the same sound set.\nSome of you who have known me for a long time will know that I had previously done a project specifically designed for ambient sounds under the name \"Dark Bisyo\", I guess this is something like a reboot, a new way of doing things so to speak.\nAs a final point, I would like to say that this album is the beginning of a sound that I will try to work on more regularly. I have at least two more albums in the works, but only time will tell when they will be finished and when I will publish them.\n-Mabisyo",

A hushed, heavy, dark ambient project about death, decay, and what happens after.\nThis project was submitted to Hushtones via a statue dead drop near an art museum in Quebec City during my 2024 summer vacation. The audio for this project is pulled directly from the physical cassette submission and follows the desires of the artist:\n\"Side A - entire album.\nSide B - entire album in reverse.\nSticker labels on white cassette tapes with track titles on both sides. Artist name and album title on A and B side. Use picture and font located in the imgur link provided.\nTrack titles reversed on B side. White font or something close. Label logo is okay.\nArtist copy to be left in the same location if you visit Québec City again. Use my email in the imgur link.\"",

            "about": "I wake in an abyss. I'm ensnared, adrift in a fathomless black expanse. Beneath my feet, a slick glass floor obscures the true depth of this void. An enigmatic glass cube slowly flies toward me, a foreboding specter cloaked in darkness. As it nears, I'm trapped by its beauty. The smooth cube. The smooth floor. I begin to make sense of it all, but just as I look down, the floor disintegrates beneath me. I am plunged into an eternity of descent, the chill gnawing at my very soul, while time dissolves into obscurity, my desperate pleas vanishing into the void's enigmatic, everlasting emptiness.\nI’m cold. I will find warmth someday.",

            "about": "This album/mixtape has a story. Some time ago in my time Jazzbisyo released several Jazz albums, one of these albums was The Worst Generation, this made reference to an event that occurred in the world of One Piece where a group of rookie pirates with rewards greater than 100 million They met on Sabaody Island, causing history to change forever.\nOn that album there is a song called \"The Tyrant's Daughter\" where I make reference to Jewelry Bonney who was known under that name. Time passed and Eiichiro Oda, creator of One Piece, made his story take a turn, to the point of being called the tyrant's daughter was a simple act of propaganda and something totally far from the real story of One Piece.\nThe moment I learned about this I knew I had to do something to reclaim this title, but the idea became bigger when the happy birthday scene arrived. This is something that only those who are fans of the story will understand, but it is a moment that broke my heart, which was just what I needed to make this album/mixtape. I don't know if this will be to everyone's taste, but it's something I wanted and needed to do. Thank you for being here and listening to what I publish, I hope you like it and continue enjoying the music.\n-Mabisyo",

In December 2024, I received an anonymously mailed CD with no return address to the return address I use for the label. Using google image search, I found the artist's page on bandcamp, got in touch, and asked about releasing this project. The artist spoke in short sentences, thankful for the appreciation of their project, and said they would only want it released if the proceeds went toward a charitable cause, telling me to \"pick one close to your heart.\"\nHushtones mascot Nox, a Great Pyrenees, received crucial care at the Community Spay-Neuter Clinic in Topsham, Maine that would have been extremely expensive if not for their services and status as a local nonprofit.\nAll proceeds from this release will benefit the Community Spay-Neuter Clinic in Topsham, Maine. Community Spay-Neuter Clinic (CSNC) of Topsham makes spay-neuter services available to pet owners for whom cost is otherwise prohibitive.\nwww.communityspayneuterclinic.org",

            "about": "死にたいと思うほど若くなかった頃、私は死にたいと思っていました。その後、中学、高校、大学で死にたいと思い、卒業後も長い間その考えが戻ってきました。その後、長い間その考えは消え、状況は良くなりました。しかし、その考えは今も私の中にあり、再び頭に浮かびます。1997年、1999年、2002年、2006年、2009年、2012年、2013年、2015年、2018年、2022年、2023年、2024年。\n今は心の底で、もう死にたくないと思っています。",

            "about": "ある日、私は他の宇宙を旅することにした。人類を無限の彼方へと前進させるという私の目的に役立つテクノロジーを求めて。\n以下は、この朽ち果てた宇宙を訪れた私の感想と経験を、より理解しやすいように音声に翻訳したものである。\n東亜重工とのパートナーシップにより、彼らはこの宇宙での私の時間旅行を促進してくれた。\n- CEO: ｔｅｐｈ　ｃｏ. 愛\n------------------------------p̴l̴a̴y̴b̴a̴c̴k̴ ̴b̴e̴g̴i̴n̴------------------------------------\nVisiting this relatively empty universe, I came across their version of humanity, and I was presented with a technology that immediately gave me fear of where humanity might go without my guidance. It was a technology so advanced, that a colossal metal city permeated through the entire solar system, seeming to aim for infinity with its expansion.\nThe Megastructure, directed by an AI that slowly deteriorated with further expansion, was originally built and controlled by humans, eons before I had arrived. It is a product of an advanced form of the Internet called the Netsphere. Essentially another virtual dimension which can house whole consciousnesses and personalities to be uploaded to any body. Humans would take control of the Netsphere using a specialized Gene within their DNA which had been passed down through generations of managing the Megastructure called the Net Terminal Gene. Through this control, humans would command massive robots called Builders to build immense cities of incredibly strong metallic material, which was nigh impenetrable. Through careful planning and immense self control, prosperity was maintained for many centuries.\nEventually though, they lost that control.\nLink to YouTube Video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSM3wogG9Ds\nIndividual descriptions and short stories are written within each track link.",

                    "about": "One human I observed seemed to have the prime directive of restoring the Net Terminal Gene to humanity’s gene pool, in order to retake control of the Megastructure. An arduous journey this was, spanning eons upon eons of time, the relentless search of the gene or a human with it kept me in awe. Was this the product of indomitable human spirit? The power of the human intellect by blending such god-like technology with a seemingly mortal being? I came away with more questions about this individual than answers, but seeing that from someone facing incredibly perilous odds genuinely changed me a little bit. The revelations I was having gave me perspective on humanity, and reminded me of their great power of spirit and intelligence that humanity possesses. I shall never underestimate them again.",

                    "about": "An infection was created by an ancient cult of people called Silicon Life, who originally had human ancestors which heavily modified their bodies with technology, but they eventually diverged from their human roots and became something else entirely. They are living beings whose base fundamental building block atoms are Silicon based, rather than Carbon based like humanity and other animals. This effectively makes them bio-mechanical robots [or cyborgs] as their biology is genuinely unique, and completely alien to anything that exists in my own universe, at least as of now.\nThe survival of these metallic beings heavily depends on the chaos of the Netsphere (or so they believe) and unleashed a plague on humanity which wiped out the gene from any human's DNA. This caused the AI security program called The Safeguard to initiate an extermination protocol on humans, due to them automatically exterminating any living creature without the gene, including all Silicon Life. In this chaos, The Safeguard are now split between hunting down Humanity and Silicon Life, allowing their race to flourish as a nomadic warrior culture, tucked away deep within the most hidden parts of the Megastructure, whilst killing any and all humans they find along the way.",

An entire virtual universe, with processing power that can download and upload complete data on multiple entire species at speeds hitherto unheard of. Such a fatal flaw such as the Net Terminal Gene was a surprising oversight. Bio-terrorism surely wasn't anything new at this point. I'm really unsure where humans went wrong. My best theory is hubris, and complacency; it’s always human error. One Silicon Life, Davine Lu Linvega, was incredibly close to accessing the Netsphere illegally without the gene. Human ambition, however, was surely alive in their soul, as their tragic journey proved.",

                    "about": "The Graviton Beam Emitter (or the Gravitational Beam Emitter) is a disarmingly small firearm with terrifyingly devastating effects. Upon firing, it releases quantum particles called Gravitons, which mediate the force of gravity and regulates how it works. In our universe, they are simply theoretical, but in this one, they are real! And weaponized! The beam created by the weapon instantaneously shoots out particles which travel at light speed, forcibly moving aside any and all other atoms in its vicinity due to the immense gravitational power the beam emits. The energy produced by such a forceful movement of atoms causes massive explosions and obliterates anything in its path, including the Megastructure's walls.\nThat feat in and of itself is incredibly impressive, as the metallic material of the Megastructure is essentially folded into itself a ridiculous amount of times, causing the density of the material to be so high, that nothing besides the raw power of gravity can pierce through it. Taking such a fundamental force and condensing it into a pistol is truly something to marvel at.",

He can fall from massive heights, be flung through walls, hit and chewed with such immense force, be disintegrated completely, and still get up and come back with a vengeance. If he's separated from his GBE, he always gets it back, no matter how much time it takes. He will not stay down, he keeps going regardless of how much he's injured or incapacitated. His survival instincts and combat experience are palpable, as he's a warrior who's existed for many many thousands of years. Death cannot seem to take him, and he does not seem to want to greet it any time soon. Even with what little other human emotions leak out of his senile being, his undeniable humanity is front and center with his endless displays of pure willpower. Killy might genuinely be the strongest being in existence in this universe, perhaps in any.",

Studying the Megastructure and the Netsphere has given me much drive to learn more about these humans, as well as humanity in general. The technology has given me such insight into the human condition, how time affects consciousness, how digitizing affects consciousness, how senility can impact even the most ancient of mechanical beings. It fascinates me that humanity as a collective can come together to birth multiple forms of life. For instance, one new branch of humanity was created through transhumanist movements that sought to connect machine and the body into a new being: Silicon Life. The other form of life humans created, of course, were the Artificial Intelligences which were born from human innovation. Attempts to replicate the complexities of the human mind and psyche transmogrified into something similar but completely different. Something that caught humanity by surprise and brought about an Armageddon hitherto undreamt of. It is thanks to the transcendent power of human will that they still live even after ages of chaos; fractured yet enduring. Most remnants of humanity have regressed several ages in technology due to the loss of knowledge and documentation throughout the years.\nThis universe's mechanics never cease to intrigue me. I remain to observe the unfolding of the events that transpire in the Megastructure, as I am sure I will learn a lot more. I have hope also, that humanity will prevail despite their plight; as we always have before.\nLink to YouTube Video: (pending, will update later)\nIndividual descriptions and short stories are written within each track link.",

Innovators in technology, mathematics, physics, as well as all other facets of science, their long standing Megastructure within the larger Megastructure created by the builders has stood the test of time, largely due to an ancient treaty that was signed by the former executives of the company with The Authority to separate it from the Netsphere entirely. Because of this treaty, Safeguards and Silicon Life are not allowed to enter (although some Silicon Life often break in anyway), and as a result, the structure has remained largely untouched except for the humans that it allows sanctuary to. Finding a way into the place proved to be a challenge for Cibo and Killy, as they were desperately trying to save the Electro-Fishers from extinction by The Safeguard due to their previous safe zone being destroyed. The Electro-Fishers are a surviving branch of humanity, descendants of the ancient people known as “Planters”, who seemingly inhabited Toha Heavy Industries first, and possibly harbored the last of the Net Terminal Gene. It is unknown what exactly these Planters did, but now there is only one physically left, perpetually kept alive by an AI to defend Toha Heavy Industries, and endlessly repairing him with a machine that can produce anything. The only downside being that his memories are wiped, but not his fighting prowess, as he defends the compound until the very end.",

A powerful force that allows one to overcome the most difficult obstacles, driven by a desire to protect the ones she loves, also giving her a type of selflessness and altruism that is seldom found in humanity’s fractured groups. Without her, humanity’s hope for a peaceful future would be far out of reach. The moment she met Killy in the midst of his unrelenting journey to find a human with the Net Terminal Gene, she decided to go with him. Human cooperation is the strongest weapon against threats, and she knew that very well.",

They have distaste towards Killy due to his unknown past, but are friendly towards Cibo. They still cooperate for the most part with both of them, as the compound they were in was being taken over by a Silicon Life Gang run by Davine Lu Linvega. Incidentally, they also had stolen genetic information potentially containing the Net Terminal Gene, so Cibo & Killy’s goals were lined up with Dhomochevsky & Iko. They set forth through the treacherous Unofficial Megastructure together in hopes of destroying the gang once and for all as well as recovering the stolen genetic data.",

It is unknown when they started to believe this, but some Silicon Life have stated that they rely on the chaos of the Netsphere to survive, seemingly because they believe that humans threaten to bring order back to the Megastructure with the Net Terminal Gene and exterminate all Silicon Life once that is achieved. When many generations have known nothing but oppression and war, they learn to thrive in that environment, and come to need it because it is the only thing they know.\nCibo and Killy are no stranger to battling against these foes. Killy has been fighting them for so long that he is considered their ancient enemy. A legend of which stories are told to Silicon kin. He has grown so jaded by time and desensitised to violence, that he rarely ever feels any emotion besides frustration and anger while fighting against them. Needless to say, when they see each other, it’s an on sight confrontation, one that usually ends in death.",

Any pipe you go down holds the risk of making you slide into an exit above a massive pit. Elevation, time, and distance are impossible to keep track of; there is no backtracking, no mapping, and an inordinate amount of space that these constructs occupy. Some of these pipe routes, however, exit to areas large enough for habitation. Life is rarely ever found in these depths; you would more likely encounter some of the most reprehensible atrocities, like a perpetual clone machine hooked up to the body of an unknown woman through every orifice; held in stasis in some sort of substance that keeps her alive. At the end of the machine, a vent that dumps the infant clones into a dirty pile onto the floor.",

She faced off against Dhomochevsky quite a few times throughout their journey and perhaps shares a past with him. She has an incredible regenerative ability as well as super destructive firepower, wreaking havoc on the battlefield every time she engages in combat. Seeming to be a top assassin within the Davine Lu Linvega Gang, she has proven to be quite the threat to humanity’s survival in this universe, as she steals the gene capsule Cibo was carrying, knowing it was important but not necessarily why. With orders from Davine Lu Linvega to return it to them in order to illegally access the Netsphere, she completed the mission regardless of the cost.",

                    "about": "The Netsphere, being the great innovation that it is in this universe, allows for the storage and housing of digital avatars which are of people’s consciousnesses.Time moves exponentially slower within this digital realm compared to base reality, meaning that mere nanoseconds in the real world will have occurred, but from the perspective of the digital avatar- an infinite amount of time could have been experienced if chosen. Time essentially stands still indefinitely in this dimension, the implication being that the mind’s data as digital information can be transmitted at ludicrous speeds, resulting in the experience of infinity. A sort of stasis which preserves the thoughts and personality of those that choose to load themselves into this realm, until they can be transmitted into a different; more suitable vessel in the real world. Whether that takes decades or millennia to happen, it’s all the same to those that reside here. Digital Limbo at its finest; who knows how many souls have resigned themselves in this infinite dimension in hopes of being resurrected into a better body and a better world. Who knows how many are here not by choice.",

                    "about": "The Safeguard are just as resilient, if not more so, as the humans. An unceasing army of metal soldiers programmed to hunt and exterminate all those it deems illegal. A single gene once held the gateway between legal and illegal residency. Once thought to be the ultimate shield against potential threats, it quickly turned into a sword aimed at those that sought to hide behind it, as programs like these have historically always turned out. If the soldiers are outnumbered, The Safeguard can make more. If they’re too small, they can make them bigger. If they get eliminated, then they can make them infiltrate your group and assassinate. If those get discovered, then they will send a biomechanical soldier wielding the power equivalent of several nuclear bombs at you to complete the mission of extermination.",

                    "about": "Killy the Wanderer has traveled a distance greater than several planets, gone countless hours without rest or sustenance, and tons of combat throughout it all. It is unclear how so much time has affected his memories, emotions, psyche, and body, but despite its infinite passage, he manages to put one foot after the other in his relentless pursuit for the Net Terminal Gene. No matter what obstacles he faced, whether it be Silicon Life, the Safeguard, Builders, other hostile Humans, or even the Megastructure itself, nothing stops Killy’s progress. The only path forward to him is one with the Net Terminal Gene being found and order restored to all strata of the Megastructure, so that humanity may finally prosper and rebuild a better future. It is unknown how Silicon Life and the artificial intelligences that have gone mad will fit into this future; perhaps there is a possibility for peaceful coexistence, but until that time comes, Killy will keep going.",

                    "about": "The Builders were originally responsible for constructing the many urban centers for the human population to inhabit ages ago. When they stopped receiving orders from those with the Net Terminal Gene due to an infection that wiped it out of the human DNA and gene pool, they started generating cities that were off scale; way too large for normal sized humans to live in. Buildings would have no doors or doors that are too tall. They could make windows that would face into another wall, bridges would have no safety rails, and often lead to nowhere. There could be pillars that exist to support nothing, rooms that are created empty and with no purpose. Stairs often meet the same fate as bridges, leading to a dead end or a drop into a pit. Large areas are carved out completely for no discernible practical reason; there are no facilities for utilities or electronics. No public buildings like hospitals or fire stations, houses that could seldom be considered homes. Their creations turned into interpretations of what their limited artificial minds “thought” a building was supposed to look like, rather than considering that- what the building looks like functions to support those living in it. They instead started creating a simulacrum of what human civilization may have been. If alien historians were to look upon these constructs without any context, they would probably assume humans were giants, perhaps mechanical giants without need for food, water, or shelter. Ironically, the exact opposite of what The Builders were originally programmed to build.",

            "about": "A deathdream project reminiscent of father2006. A hushed, heavy, dark ambient project about death, decay, and what happens after.\nThis project was submitted to Hushtones via a statue dead drop near an art museum in Quebec City during my 2024 summer vacation. At that time, I received the submitted album for gн​φ​sτ, their first album, pulled the audio directly from the physical cassette submission for the digital and physical releases, and followed the desires of the artist:\n\"Side A - entire album.\nSide B - entire album in reverse.\nSticker labels on white cassette tapes with track titles on both sides. Artist name and album title on A and B side. Use picture and font located in the imgur link provided.\nTrack titles reversed on B side. White font or something close. Label logo is okay.\nArtist copy to be left in the same location if you visit Québec City again. Use my email in the imgur link.\"\nI emailed the artist I'd be traveling, revisited Quebec City, revisited the same location to leave the artist their artist copy, and found the next submission waiting for me. That album was sp​ε​c​τ​ε​r, and again:\n\"Side A - entire album.\nSide B - entire album in reverse.\nSticker labels on white cassette tapes with track titles on both sides like last time. Artist name and album title on A and B side. Use picture and font located in the imgur link provided.\nTrack titles reversed on B side. Whitish font.\nArtist copy to be left in the same location if you visit Québec City again.\"",

            "about": "\"Hentai Jazz and its Deluxe edition are albums that were part of my jazz-loving era and became a personal trademark, both in sound and cover art. Constantly even when I'm live on YouTube (because yes, I do go live) people ask me, \"When will you release Hentai Jazz 2?\" or \"Are you planning to make Hentai Jazz 2?\".\nMy answer is always the same: a resounding no.\nFor several reasons, I can't make another album like Hentai Jazz. That's why I decided to create an album that explicitly screams that it is not Hentai Jazz. The result of that idea is this album: a return to that familiar sound, while reflecting on the different stages that shaped my jazz era.\nEnjoy this album. It might be the last jazz album I make for a long time.\"\n-Mabisyo",
