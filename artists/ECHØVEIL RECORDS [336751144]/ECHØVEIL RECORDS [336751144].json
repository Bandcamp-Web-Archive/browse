            "about": "Шуморење is an experimental dungeon synth apparition by Patron Requiem, a project that exhales atmospheric black metal, funereal trap, orphaned rap echoes, and a mephistophelian dark ambient fog. It also stands as a side-project of tvnalad, known for post-black metal corroded by trap residues and mortuary rhythms.\nThere is a particular pleasure in wandering the cavernous underlevels of the Internet at pale hours, hunting for new diffuse and haunted sonic ecstasies, and suddenly colliding with something that feels both ancient and wrong. Patron Requiem emerges there, clutching a dust-choked dungeon synthesizer that sounds nostalgic, hypnotic, brittle, and strangely delicious. Very quickly, it becomes clear this is not traditional dungeon synth but a more hallucinogenic, wayward beast.\nYes, the venomous melancholy is present, that romantic spleen associated with old-school dark dungeon music, but it is infected by something else: instrumental trap stripped of all its celebratory instincts. Trap as a corpse. Rap cadavers drifting like unidentified remains through a slimy graveyard on a frozen wasteland.\nThe intrepid Serbian hand behind Patron Requiem touches something rare here, almost miraculous. Шуморење unfolds as a journey through enveloping mists that contaminate wandering minds, transmuting pathos into something dreamlike, funereal, and unexpectedly euphoric.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "The Mad Alchemist's Whispering Skull\nIf kept in a perfectly silent room one can hear the Mad Alchemist's whisperings.\nThe whisperings reveal many valuable secrets as well as many flights of fancy, usually intermingled.\nA caution, all who have spent time listening to the skull have eventually gone mad themselves.\nEndless Hourglass\nAs the name states, the sands of this hourglass never have fallen to an end.\nNone know what will happen if they do end.\nSpectacles Of Stygian Sight\nAllow one to see many entities who wish to remain hidden to plain sight.\nIt should be noted that many hidden entities do not take kindly to being seen.\nAgrippa's Inkwell Of Maledictions\nIf filled with ink of the proper formulation,\nany harm described befalling an individual,\nno matter how grievous, will befall them.\nThere is currently no known record of the proper formulation of ink.\nThe Shawm of Dantalion\nSignificantly magnifies the player's natural abilities,\nto the point where even one who has no skill whatsoever may deliver a virtuoso performance.\nAn Almanac of Secret Stars\nDescribes the natures of certain stars not visible to the naked eye nor the best spyglass,\nwhere and when those stars may be located and seen,\nand what benefits or detriments they may bring to enterprises carried out under their light.\n-OLD MOTH DREAMS\n---\nA Curious Collection is a cracked reliquary from Old Moth Dreams, that extraordinary occult-drenched dungeon-synth aberration hatched somewhere beneath the damp stones of Providence, Rhode Island. Nothing hits quite like these phantasmal transmissions: pure and beautiful madness, a kind of corrupted neoclassical dungeon-noise delirium where Lovecraftian echoes slither through every pore and contaminate the whole lattice of sound.\nHere, damned prog-rock atmospheres ooze like forgotten ectoplasms; surreal dark-ambient profanations whisper in broken tongues; psychedelic vapors coil and uncoil in slow, impossible geometries.\nIt is macabre, yes. It is unpredictable, certainly. It is schizophrenic fun from a parallel crypt—the sort of delirious sonic artifact you find only once in a lifetime, trembling in your hands, wondering how it got here… and why it seems to be breathing.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A Surfeit of Lampreys invites the listener to a hyper-tonal, minimalist, and surreal banquet, where the mind is confronted with repetitions of celestial yet disturbed musical patterns. These figures interrogate one another, attempt replies, circle endlessly around a glittering, prehistoric metaphysical dilemma that refuses resolution.\nThis is cinema for the ears.\nImagine Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Moondog composing the soundtrack to a utopian film about quantum physics and impossible birds gliding above a rediscovered Atlantis. Koyaanisqatsi submerged in a torrent of LSD. The music of SimCity, but reprogrammed by Man Ray and Giorgio de Chirico.\nWhat emerges is a euphoric loop of beauty, fleeting yet eternal, strange, stubborn, and opaque. A deeply addictive unidentified sonic object, where disquiet entwines with flickering lights, tracing the unstable cartography of a destiny that will never cease to redraw itself.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "queer noise worshiping the female body\n---\nErrant Static is no longer as it once was.\nThe name lingers like a scorched afterimage, a residue of voltage and breath trapped in the walls. This formidable project of experimental noise, corrupted power electronics and ritualistic drone doom has released its final solo emissions, then quietly sealed that chapter away. Going forward, Errant Static will exist only in the margins: through collaborations and compilations, as a presence rather than a solitary voice. ECHØVEIL will forever carry the pride, and the wound, of having sheltered within its smoking entrails some of Errant Static’s most precious sonic relics. This project was, and remains, profoundly dear to me.\nIt is within this funereal silence that I am granted the tainted privilege of unveiling A Taste Of Eden, one of the artist’s final solo offerings. Four minimalist harsh queer noise pieces, slow-burning and hypnotic, essential in their restraint, almost liturgical in intent. Errant Static allows the sound to breathe, to settle, to fester, patiently shaping a corrupt and devotional atmosphere where decay feels deliberate, sacred even.\nThese noise-litanies unfold as a reverent homage to the feminine body in all its power, fragility, and radiance. Not representation, but invocation. Not violence, but surrender. The sound does not attack; it envelops, coils, whispers, and waits.\nTaste without guilt.\nLet yourself drift.\nAbsorb every second Errant Static prepared for us before withdrawing into the shadows.\nThe journey is slow, unsettling, and profoundly worth it.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A Threshold / Eine Schwelle, is the first split release by Gogol (AUS) and HELLBERG (DE).\nStep through a dense, cold space, slow, heavy, without haste, without turning back.\nMovement in the shadowy realm between threat and awe. Soundscapes like distant horizons, deep frequencies like subterranean rumblings. As if something immense were breathing in the darkness, and you can only hear its edges.\nYet beneath the weight lies something else: a fragile musicality, almost invisible, like light you do not see but feel. No salvation rather, a quiet suggestion that even darkness has structure, and that something can emerge from it.\n- Gogol & HELLBERG\n---\nTwo projects I hold close to the nerve, finally intertwined.\nA split that breathes in slow spirals: hypnotic, nostalgic, quietly celestial. Four pieces, two per artist, suspended in that fragile corridor between states, where waking dissolves but sleep has not yet claimed the body. Night leaks into day. Thought becomes texture.\nOn the sealed underside of the eyelid, fading dreams begin to harden into something almost real. Not memory. Not illusion. Something adjacent.\nGogol and Hellberg guide this inward drift with remarkable precision, shaping an inner passage through contemplative drone, cosmic ambient, and a strain of surreal, noisy, frostbitten dungeon synth that feels both distant and intimately lodged beneath the skin.\nA masterful convergence. A threshold crossed without noticing.\nThe naturalist soundtrack to Kepler-22 b.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Black smoke first. Not a cloud, not a metaphor. A total occupation. Vision erased, direction annulled, the idea of elsewhere burned out of the mind. A Worthy Decay begins already lost. Cosmic Fumes drags you into the smoke and lets go. No hand, no voice, no exit. Only density.\nA single drone-doom mass, ambient in the way extinction is ambient, everywhere, unavoidable, without emphasis. The fire arrives without spectacle. It eats forests the same way it eats cities, patiently, evenly, without hatred. Buildings soften. Rivers forget their paths. Names dissolve. Souls follow.\nThis is not collapse. Collapse implies speed. This is consumption stretched thin, a long burn where everything learns how to disappear correctly. The smoke thickens until there is no longer a difference between breathing and surrender. Cosmic Fumes lets the tone persist long past meaning, long past resistance, until even despair loses its shape.\nWhen the sound finally vanishes, there is no release. No opening. The silence is not empty space. It is confirmation. Proof that nothing continued, that nothing escaped, that nothing remains to listen. Not quiet. Not peace. The silence of inexistence, where even the memory of sound has been erased.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Abrasive Deluge unfolds as a gravitational event rather than an album.\nConceived by Greek sound artist Substak, its core is a single, monumental composition of nearly twenty minutes. A continuous pressure field. An abrasive surge without shoreline or horizon. Listening becomes drift, erosion, surrender.\nThere is no narrative, only immersion.\nA storm made of texture, density, and void.\nNoise as weather. Silence as residue.\nThe sound mass grinds and blooms simultaneously, woven from fluctuating interferences, primordial cosmic snow, and mute, suspended tensions. The listener is pulled into an uncertain absence, a melancholic elsewhere where orientation collapses. Solitary, lunar, solemn. A state of quiet awe. A beatific dislocation.\nTime loosens its grip. Molecules vibrate with an electricity older than memory. Every atom hums with a charge that predates form itself. Joy, doubt, vertigo, loss of bearings, all coexist in a single, slow continuum. One is nowhere, and everywhere, all at once.\nThe second piece emerges as an afterimage.\nA phantom reflection.\nHere, Sir Kuliktavikt intervenes not to repeat, but to unmake. The original mass is dismantled, diffused, haunted. A post-ambient deconstruction. A residue of the deluge, refracted through absence and echo. Sound becomes specter, debris, drifting anti-form. A navigation through forbidden skies, guided by a liquid compass, tracing ecstatic negations.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Beneath ten thousand feet of earth, under a viscous swamp fat with refuse and half-eaten saints, lies the cathedral of Necromantic Nightmare’s Abstractum et Obscurum. Not built. Not carved. Secreted.\nThe marsh above it writhes, electrically gravid, colossal amphibians gnawing on seasoned fragments of the formerly human, their throats croaking psalms in a language that tastes like rust. The mud vibrates. The air foams. Everything sweats decomposition.\nInside, all groans. All sags. All rots.\nThe organ does not play. It expectorates black mire. Each note is a deliberate drowning, lungs filling with tar, a choir of eyeless putrefacts chanting fever-hymns to a god who molted centuries ago. The pews are split ribs. The aisle is a throat. Gigantic white worms promenade with sacerdotal calm, whispering atrocities into the cracks of the wood, glutting themselves on dead-star syrup and damp soot. They do not crawl. They administer.\nAt the altar, a priest with a bifurcated crystal tongue caresses the cadaver of a bird while carving his cheeks with a blade that emits a radiance unknown to physics, unknown to mercy. He laughs. He sobs. He convulses in jubilation, vomiting prayers to anti-time, to retrograde eternities that gnash their teeth backward.\nMirrors liquefy. Stained glass hemorrhages dried blood. The architecture rejoices in its own collapse, beams bending like vertebrae eager to snap. Everything celebrates rot as revelation.\nAnd beneath the church, deeper still, an immense eye sleeps. Closed. Trembling. Dreaming of hinges.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A requiem for everything that once dared to breathe.\nA choir of rusted sirens, whispering into the vacuum left by vanished suns.\nHere, melody is a fossil—memory decaying beneath the static of uncreation.\nThe machines hum like dying gods; the winds remember names no one can speak.\nBeauty still flickers, trembling and emaciated, beneath the ash.\nIt is the final call of an extinct songbird echoing through the circuitry of the end.\nA lamentation without audience, without hope—\nand yet, impossibly, still radiant in its despair.\n(anti)Music For Mass Extinction:\nnot music, but its aftermath.\nNot life, but the ghost of its resonance.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt\n----\nYou have heard said that Humanity is the Devil. In fact, Humanity had become something much worse. A Cancer, a toxic, tumorous poison that had grown and metastasized in the bloodstream of the Earth, gourging itself off the fat of the land and leaving nothing but an emaciated hollowed out shell of life behind. A Cancer belching carcinogenic soot and petrochemicals from its plastic lungs. A sick parody of The Natural Order of Creation, an Abomination.\n\"Now in the people that were meant to be green there is no more life of any kind. There is only shriveled barrenness. The winds are burdened by the utterly awful stink of evil, selfish goings-on. Thunderstorms menace. The air belches out the filthy uncleanliness of the peoples. The earth should not be injured! The earth must not be destroyed!\" - Hildegard Of Bingen\nRevelation 8:10 - 11\n10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.\n\"The Earth should not be injured. The Earth must not be destroyed. As often as the elements of the World are violated by ill treatment, so God will cleanse them. God will cleanse them through the sufferings and hardships of humankind. All of creation God gives to humankind to use. But if this privilege is misused, then God permits creation to punish humanity.\" - Hildegard Of Bingen\nRevelation 21\n1 Then I saw a New Heaven and a New Earth, for the first Heaven and the first Earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.",

            "about": "Apart Delight opens like a door that should have remained sealed.\nTerrible dreams accumulate behind the eyes. Withered hauntings. Schizoid derailments. The simple act of existing becomes an offense punished by sound. Ikunaa does not compose drones so much as cultivate them, slow-growing acoustic fungi that seep into walls, nerves, memories. This is a world darker than black, a place where hope has entered its terminal phase and continues breathing only out of spite.\nThe drone melts souls. It haunts and is haunted in return. It rots matter, corrodes identities, eats through steel, skin, language. Soot-creatures rise from the ground and drift into a sky with unstable geometry, where clouds grin and crackle with morbid electricity. Vegetation turns sickly and bioluminescent, creeping across cities like a deliberate infection, swallowing streets, buildings, bedrooms. A mortuary-city emerges, populated by warped children who stare without blinking.\nOn every lamppost, a dog’s head has been mounted like a warning or a prayer gone wrong. Blood, still warm, drips onto the pavement in slowed time, as if the world itself is reluctant to finish the gesture. Each sound is another nail, driven patiently into an already bruised mind. The cortex floods with the impossible. Lovecraftian immensities press inward, announcing madness not as a future event but as a present condition.\nApart Delight is not an album. It is an inhabitable dread. Entering it means consenting to erosion. Leaving it means carrying something back with you.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Audax. The Latin word for bold; reckless. As these sounds were forming, I realized they sounded like engines churning and scraping. Great mechanical interactions. Maybe I was angry. Maybe I was sad. Whatever the cause, the beasts are here now, working low on fuel. My soul is free to let the sounds rush me to and fro. The noise is searching and moving. Repetitively restless.\n-Saint Elisabeth\n---\nWe continue our excavation of the noise-ridden past of sound artist Saint Elisabeth with this third reissue in our series devoted to tracing his discographic trajectory. This time, listeners are invited to immerse themselves in Audax, an album originally released in early 2025.\nIt marked a departure of sorts.\nHere, sound is no longer invoked as invocation or ritual, but reshaped, stripped down, and re-forged into something purely mechanical. Rusted car engines grind and idle inside an echo chamber suspended in a near-infinite void. Poisoned pistons throb like overheated hearts, locked in a perpetual state of imminent failure. What emerges are the industrial entrails of a city without a soul, without intent, without redemption.\nThese sounds search, but never arrive. They grope forward, hesitate, question themselves, then collapse endlessly back into their own debris. Motion without progress. Force without meaning. A closed circuit of pressure and fatigue.\nIf earlier works sought the absolute through biblical figures and fractured theology, Audax turns instead toward a colder axis. The absolute is no longer divine, but mechanical. It resides in the sterile purity of a turbine spinning endlessly, tirelessly, for no reason at all. A machine worshipping its own momentum. An indifferent engine replacing the absent (?) god.\nDeus ex machina.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Spaghetti Blacc finally breaches the perimeter of ECHØVEIL. A total artist, a surrealist rap prodigy who may at any moment mutate into black metal smeared with no wave scabs and power electronics afterburn. Commitment level: catastrophic. With Spaghetti Blacc, you never know where the ground is, or if there ever was one. Feints, trapdoors, ecstatic disorientation. Pure euphoric derailment.\nOn Autoganzfeld Reeducation, a record as dionysian as it is luciferian, the listener is force-fed a degenerate tasting menu prepared by a deranged chef with a scorched palate and no regard for structural integrity. Noise-rock hallucinations that feel like an illicit graft between early-era Michael Gira’s Swans, Japanese Zeuhl geniuses Koenji Hyakkei and John Zorn’s Naked City, still twitching, still bleeding. Brutal, incandescent avant-prog spasms colliding with feral folk aberrations worthy of a Henry Cow fever dream. A kind of dying Exotica, sickly and sunburnt, packed with rattling bolts, unstable voltages, and frequencies that refuse to stay put.\nElsewhere, anti-jazz erupts in flesh-eating castanet rituals. A slinky solo combusts mid-performance. Schizo-psychedelic death metal sloshes around in boiling fryer oil. Vectorial harsh noise siphons your grey matter through a straw carved from human bone. Black metal appears briefly, imagined by a short circuit, then self-immolates. Nothing behaves. Everything convulses. Genres are chewed, liquefied, spat back as hostile matter.\nAutoganzfeld Reeducation is not an album so much as a neurological incident, a reprogramming by excess, a carnival of ruptures disguised as entertainment. Pleasure for the whole family, provided the family has already abandoned hope, reason, and the comfort of recognizable form\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "“Before the Burial” drifts in like a vespéral fever, a slow exhalation from some forgotten crypt-machine humming beneath the Australian night. For twelve delirious minutes, Gogol sculpts a dungeon synth séance: languid, nocturnal, trembling with a tension that seems to pulse through the walls like trapped breath. Shards of horror-tinged synthwave surface and sink again—John Carpenter’s The Thing staring back from the frost—while industrial-leaning percussion begins to rattle like loose bones in a rusted centrifuge.\nIt is a perfect aberration: a modern atmospheric dungeon synth ritual crossbred with the hyperspeed ghosts of an amphetamine-charged ’80s sci-fi soundtrack. The piece rises, rises again, climbing through a sibylline, adulterated night where every shadow feels spiked with teeth. And then—silence. A fracture in the world. A voice from the cult-classic film Carnival of Souls takes center stage, murmuring despair, detachment, that slow unthreading from a reality that no longer remembers your name.\nAnd suddenly we’re dragged back under. The tension coils tighter, the synths grow heavier, more contagious, beating like a diseased aurora. Beneath the surface: an almost subliminal black-metal current, whispering through the circuitry like a parasite learning to dream.\nA masterfully controlled descent—fascinating, phantasmic, and atmospherically prodigious.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A live improvisational recording on Mabon 2025 — a decomposing ritual in shifting darkness.\n---\nBlack Crypt Necromancy is an uncompromising noise improvisation, broadcast live from the putrescent crypt of Graveyard Witchcraft. A decomposing corpse wired directly into the power grid, convulsing under raw voltage. Slabs of rancid flesh detonate beneath the electrical onslaught of a necrophagous anti-music, telluric and corrupted, forever teetering on the brink of collapse in every numb, swollen second.\nFemurs soften and melt. Viscera smoke, exhaling psychotropic vapors that crawl through the air like hallucinated incense. White maggots wander freely across the mound of moribund, grey-pink flesh, laying metallic eggs in the humus of what was once human. This is depraved noise. Night-noise. Noise born in the damp, glowing depths of a crypt, where sound ferments, pulses, and rots slowly, beautifully, beyond recognition.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "the black noise is the sonic concept and constellation is the abstract,space structure of drones\n-Substak\n---\nAn astral fever-dream mapped in ghostlight, humming with the residue of extinct oscillations.\nFive hypnotic vortices from the ultra-prolific Substak: space ambient, drone, liminal drift… the slow evaporation of thought in a vacuum older than memory. These are sound-rifts where you dissolve, where the mind becomes a wandering satellite, bruised by cosmic frost, haunted by the echo of forgotten telemetry.\nThe textures bloom like decayed frequencies, like relic signals from derelict space stations lost to entropy. Yet there is comfort here, a strange warmth in the void — the feeling of floating through an abandoned nebula that still remembers your name.\nBlack Noise Constellation is a dark and immersive descent into far-away space:\nan astral labyrinth of half-extinguished stars, slow gravitational hymns, and shadow-tasting atmospheres.\nA place where the universe hums in its sleep… and invites you to vanish into its dream.\nFollowing these five abyssal transmissions come two remixes by UgUrGkuliktavikt, where the hauntological and psychedelic DNA of Substak’s originals is dragged through Sir Kuliktavikt’s hallucinogenic prism. The tracks are deconstructed, atomized, re-assembled into unstable dream-machines — spectral pulses, fractured drones, and echo-fogged rituals that amplify the original cosmic dread while mutating it into something even stranger, more delirious, more beautifully unhinged.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

Since its inception, the project has carved a path through some of the most esoteric corners of sound exploration, releasing its first full-length album in 2022. With a prolific stream of releases that defy easy categorization, UgUrGkuliktavikt dwells in liminal sonic spaces, where genre boundaries dissolve into a dense fog of texture, atmosphere, and dissonance.\nThe project’s music spans a vast and often unsettling spectrum—ranging from dark ambient and drone to musique concrète, harsh noise wall, dungeon synth, funereal ambient, industrial, hauntological collage, and plunderphonics. Each release feels like a transmission from a decaying world, built on fragments of sound both ancient and modern, sacred and profane. The project frequently incorporates field recordings, degraded samples, lo-fi synth work, and aural decay as aesthetic tools, constructing immersive audio narratives that evoke loss, memory, spectral presence, and metaphysical dread.",

            "about": "New Paranoised album, exploring breakcore/jungle and drum n bass!!!\nFirst ten tracks are drum n bass and the last eleven are breakcore/jungle. Choose what you want to listen first. Enjoy!\n-Paranoised\n---\nParanoised returns to ECHØVEIL RECORDS.\nBut do not expect a continuation. IX now feels like a distant transmission, a corrupted memory buried under layers of static and time.\nThe early electronic deliriums are gone.\nThe haunted musique concrète has evaporated.\nWhat remains is motion. Fracture. Velocity.\nThis new album dives headfirst into a feral, euphoric hybrid of breakcore, jungle and drum & bass, pushed far beyond nostalgia or genre revival. Twenty-one short but explosive pieces unfold like a trance mechanism in permanent overload, each track snapping, mutating, collapsing into the next with nervous precision.\nYou are dragged into frozen fogbanks of rhythm, disoriented and exhilarated, dancing while your own physical presence feels unstable, reprogrammed, psychotronically reshaped. Beats stutter and surge like faulty nervous impulses. Basslines breathe, sweat, convulse. Time dissolves into pure forward momentum.\nHere, the ghosts of 90s rave culture are not resurrected but transfigured, stripped of comfort and irony, reborn as something uncanny and alive. Paranoised does not quote the past, it rewires it.\nA vertiginous, body-warping release from one of the most compelling and singular sonic architects currently at work.\nWelcome back to the fog.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Ka’Bael, the Orlando-based dungeon synth entity, stands among the most fascinating and relentlessly prolific figures of this polymorphic underground. Rooted deep in the ancestral soil of dungeon synth, the project both honors the genre’s ossified foundations and corrodes them from within, threading in hypnotic experimental noise like venom through mortar. This is musical sorcery in its purest form. Gothic, vampiric, poisonous. A sound that seduces even as it suffocates.\nThrough Ka’Bael’s possessed analog keys, the Great Old Ones crawl back into resonance. They rise from granular ash, seep into the mind, contaminate thought, and drink the soul dry. An unspeakable fog rolls in and refuses to lift. Life collapses into catacombs and impious fissures, a profaned earth crawling with impossible geometries and creatures that leak into reality itself. Elongated faces. Bared canines. Vampires stripped of all modern romance, reduced to hunger and rot.\nThis is a Middle Ages from another dimension. Darker. More putrid. More merciless. A medieval nightmare refracted through Lovecraftian dread and corroded tape hiss, where splendor and decay are fused beyond separation.\nA monumental work of shadowed art, both intoxicating and crushing. Enter the gateway, but do not expect to return unchanged.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "It begins like a séance held in a burned-out chapel — a trembling, spectral voice rising from the ashes of Bob Dylan’s “Visions of Johanna.” A ghost-folk rendition so fragile it could vanish if you breathe too loud. But then the ground splits open... And from the ruins emerges a delirious avalanche of sound collage and auditory sabotage.\nLoops melt, echoes cannibalize each other, broken pop refrains flicker like dying satellites. Violet Stargazer drags melody through the underworld, reanimating it into something unrecognizable yet strangely divine. This is DECONSTRUCTIST MAXIMALIST POP NOISE — pure sonic hysteria sculpted from chaos. A labyrinth of haunted samples, schizophrenic harmonies, and fragmented beauty clawing its way through the static.\nEverything here is too much, and yet it all fits together with obscene grace. It’s a dizzying descent into postmodern reverie — a love letter written in distortion, to the ghosts of music itself.\nUnpredictable. Beautiful. Deranged. Essential.\nThe corrupted stargazer sings, and the cosmos trembles.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Datura is a short-form offering where Inhum’An turns his attention toward the night-blooming logic of poisonous flowers. Named after the Datura genus, a family of Solanaceae whose roots spread from Mexico and the American Southwest to temperate and tropical soils worldwide, this EP unfolds like a quiet botanical rite.\nEach of the four tracks is devoted to a distinct species, not as a literal portrait but as a state of mind. Mystery drifts in slowly. Calm is laced with unease. Beauty and toxicity breathe from the same stem. The result is a gently disorienting experience, serene yet troubling, like a lucid dream with a dark aftertaste.\nListeners drawn to the early, more introspective phases of Aphex Twin and Autechre will find familiar echoes here, refracted through Inhum’An’s own experimental techno sensibility.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Ghost Voices is an unstable document.\nA ritual was initiated in darkness by Austrian sound artist Fabio Keiner. Whether it was intended as music, invocation, or simple listening remains unclear. Dark electronics were configured as receivers. Drones were sustained beyond safe duration. Frequencies were left unattended. Something answered.\nVoices entered the system without authorization. Not the dead as remembered, but the dead as interrupted processes, consciousness caught mid-collapse. They speak through corrosion, looping interference, and ritualistic pulses that resemble breath only by accident. Some voices beg. Others document. Most repeat, endlessly, the instant they realized they were gone.\nWARNING:\nThere are reports of listeners feeling accompanied long after playback has ended.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Two long-form emissions ooze through the cracks, stretched and feverish, as if time itself had softened and begun to leak. What you hear is not composition but decomposition. A pair of extended expulsions, dragged up from a bruised elsewhere where sound rots before it is born.\nThe signal is clearer now. This other world, circlum pravitatis putrida (repeat it eternally while munching on dead flies and black soil), is slowly invading our reality, inch by inch, corrupting it, tarnishing it. To the worms’ delight.\nBlack metal here is no longer a genre but a necrotic reflex. Strings sag like wet ligaments, detuned to the point of nausea, drowning beneath avalanches of corrosive noise that hiss, choke, and swarm. Rhythm appears only to be devoured seconds later. Structure flickers like a dying insect trapped in amber made of ash.\nThese two tracks do not progress.\nThey fester.\nThey circle themselves like infected wounds, swelling, collapsing, reopening. Motifs melt. Distortion curdles.\nIldjarn, Striborg, Μνήμα, Abruptum, Wold, Bakbakwalanooksiwae, Emit, Reverorum Ib Malacht, T.O.M.B., and Gnaw Their Tongues collapse into one another, their laughing corpses molding into a new depraved, monstrous entity. Tentacles burst outward. Teeth everywhere. Smiling. Licking. Vicious. Wanting.\nizprijenostь does not offer music.\nIt offers contamination.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A signal adrift in stellar rust. Pulses of forgotten machinery echo through the skin of collapsed suns. Derelicta hums like a derelict temple orbiting nowhere — a drone of slow erosion, a murmur of black wind folding over itself.\nFrom Utah’s deserts of circuitry and shadow, Errant Static channels the sound of unbeing. Since 2023 she has traversed the ruins of harsh noise, the viscera of power electronics, the sinking gravities of drone and sludge — building not worlds, but aftermaths.\nThese recordings are exhalations of dust and instinct, performed live and left to decay in real time. They flow as if time had lost its hinges, each track a corridor into the next — imperfect, wounded, luminous only in its desolation.\nDerelicta is not light but its absence: the slow bloom of darkness behind the eyelids of dying stars. A sonic mirage collapsing into silence — the echo of something that never wanted to exist.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Introducing experimental Australian sound artist Michael Baum to ECHØVEIL RECORDS.\nDetent is a three-part composition that unfolds with quiet resolve, distilling an atmosphere that is at once austere and strangely comforting. Built from the patient interplay of early electronic and electroacoustic sensibilities, sustained drones, and finely tuned microtonal tensions, the work moves like a slow mechanism releasing pressure little by little, settling into a suspended trance. Each section feels deliberate and measured, allowing subtle shifts in texture and harmony to surface over extended durations, rewarding close and immersive listening.\nAs a complement to this new work, this first release on ECHØVEIL also gathers two earlier pieces by Michael Baum, drawn from select releases on the exceptional Montreal-based netlabel Musique Moléculaire.\nmusiquemoleculaire.bandcamp.com\nThese additional tracks offer a broader glimpse into his sonic vocabulary, revealing the continuity of his approach: a careful sculpting of sound where restraint becomes expressive, and minimal gestures resonate with depth.\nTogether, these pieces form a cohesive listening experience, situating Michael Baum’s work at the crossroads of introspective electronics and meditative sonic architecture.",

            "about": "Each track of Diablerie unfolds as a warped black mass, captured through rust-eaten transistors and retransmitted by failing machines that barely remember their original purpose. The sound oscillates between scorching and glacial, a destabilizing vertigo where death industrial collapses into drone-synth hallucinations, where structure decays in real time.\nThere are no songs here, only rituals in various stages of decomposition. Circuits gasp, rhythms stumble and disintegrate, frequencies rot from the inside. Something ancient moves beneath the noise, not quite demonic, not quite mechanical, as if the machines themselves had inherited a memory of blasphemy.\nListening to Diablerie is a perpetual fall. Not ecstatic. Not liberating. Merely inevitable. A surrender to gravity, to entropy, to the quiet certainty that the mass will continue long after the listener has stopped resisting.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "William Covert arrives on ECHØVEIL RECORDS ! Dream Vessel is the much anticipated follow-up to Dream Void, which was released last year on Musique Moléculaire:\nmusiquemoleculaire.bandcamp.com/album/dream-void\nStill operating at the crossroads of avant-prog, free improvisation, cinematic ambient, synthwave and restless math-rock, Covert pushes the trio format into tighter, more kinetic forms. The collaborative tracks strike with coiled precision, knotty rhythms snapping into place before dissolving again, recalling the nervous intelligence of Grails, the fractal logic of King Crimson’s ProjeKcts, or Battles caught mid-calculation. These pieces feel engineered and feral at once, muscles flexing beneath shifting time signatures.\nIn contrast, the solo and more ambient passages fold inward. Here, Covert drifts into a haunted suspension, sculpting vaporous soundfields from analog synths, spectral overtones, and slow-moving harmonic residue. The synthwave influence surfaces as a kind of submerged memory, nocturnal and blurred, less neon than afterimage. Drums, Covert’s primary instrument, still surface in these pieces, not as propulsion but as pulse, fascinating, riveting, hypnotic, the heartbeat of an unstable dream engine threatening to stall or overheat.\nDream Vessel is another remarkable transmission from a singular musician, composer, and sonic architect, a record that breathes, recalibrates, and slowly reprograms the listener from the inside.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

Now the bass has teeth. Now the air stinks of violet combustion and collapsing timelines.\nVIOLET SMOKE / VIOLET SMOKE / VIOLET SMOKE —\ndrifting like narcotic ectoplasm through your lungs, turning your nerves into sparking copper threads.\nTen thousand tons of psychotropic fog fall directly onto your skull. Your skull cracks, politely at first, then with obscene laughter.\nThe illbient monsters are here again — or were they ever gone?\nJaw hinges of molten steel, clattering in the roasted dark, dripping neon drool onto your trembling heartbeat.\nTheir voices are drowned sirens, reversed prayers, basslines sharpened into surgical blades.\nYour stomach fills with a glacial fire.\nYour grin widens. Wider. Wider.\nYou cough up corrupted sub-bass, rusted bolts fused to cartilage, spider corpses twitching with residual electricity. A hundred. A thousand. They scatter like cracked stars.\nEverything spins.\nEverything leers.\nEverything hums with that sickening, exhilarating frequency that only the truly damned can love.\nCUT / CUT / CUT-UP:\nvisions of Scorn mutating into Godflesh collapsing into Andy Stott exploding inside DJ Spooky recombining through Andrew Nolan dissolving into The Bug splitting into Techno Animal into into into Scientist's brain—\nA glitching bestiary of industrial ghosts dances behind your eyelids.\nYou can’t tell if you're hallucinating or if hallucinations are now hallucinating you. Maybe both. Maybe none.\nThe city dissolves.\nThe city rots.\nThe city becomes a swollen black lung pumping vapor-drugs directly into your bloodstream.\nRain tastes like burnt circuitry.\nStreetlamps ooze marrow.\nYour shadow whispers advice you cannot trust.\nAnd yet — god, the thrill —\nthat ecstatic dread, that trembling euphoria,\nthe promise that you're about to exceed the perimeter of your own mind and never find the way back.\nDub For The National Health is not music; it is contraband from another dimension, a ritual stimulant smuggled through ruptured realities, a black-mass narcotic engineered for brains that no longer fear the consequences.\nA warning, then:\nThis album moves on its own.\nThis album watches you.\nThis album will change your chemistry.\nAnd you will beg it for more.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "And now... for something completely different, we have the enigmatic Akhalis, multi-instrumentalist conjured from the psychotropic mists of Saint Eustache, Québec.\nDuologie Féline unites two sprawling works—Chaton and Papatte—each a pair of entwined, long-form suites that stretch and curl like smoke through infinite dimensions. Here, sound dissolves, folds, and refracts in a kaleidoscopic haze of psychedelic incantations: a liminal plane where ambient experimentation collides with LSD-drenched post-rock, mushroom-spun prog, opiate-laden drone-noise, and cosmic shoegaze. Each note vibrates like the heartbeat of an unseen cosmos, each texture hums with the intelligence of a dreaming animal, each swell of sound opens a doorway to a deeper, wilder perception.\nListening to Duologie Féline is like wandering through a four-dimensional feline documentary, hallucinated from within the collective dream-minds of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, My Bloody Valentine, Daniel Johnston, Flying Saucer Attack, Taj Mahal Travellers, Thurston Moore, Gong, Roy Montgomery, Sunburned Hand of the Man and The Jewelled Antler Collective—only this one exists in color beyond human vision, in time beyond linear measure. One moment you float amid glittering cat-eye constellations, the next you drift through forests of sonic moss and liquid shadow, hearing the whisper of fur against unseen leaves, the murmur of tails brushing astral currents.\nThis is music to melt into, dissolve within, and surrender yourself to—a cosmic catnap of hypnotic waves, spiraling drones, fractured melodies, and strobing dreamlight. It is at once intoxicating, bewildering, comforting, and unsettling, a full immersion into a world where feline grace guides you through endless rooms of impossible sonic architecture.\nBest approached with a generous helping of catnip, a mind unbound, and the willingness to lose all sense of space, time, and reason.\nLong live Akhalis!\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Michael Baum is back on ECHØVEIL with a new fascinating EP.\nWhat we have here are two vast drone structures breathe at an inhuman interval, locked into a rhythm that resembles work rather than music. Not labor in the human sense, but mechanical persistence. Systems humming long after their architects have vanished. Circuits maintaining function inside buildings that are no longer occupied by meaning.\nBaum treats sound like a static load applied to failing architecture. Frequencies press downward, patiently, testing beams and joints. Nothing snaps. Nothing resolves. Instead, everything remains suspended in a terminal phase of erosion. Walls remember being walls. Columns still hold, though they no longer believe in gravity. This is drone as infrastructure fatigue.\nThere is a calm here, but it is the calm of a control room with no operators left. A meditative stasis saturated with corrosion. Time stretches, thins, oxidizes. The listener’s perception slows until it aligns with rust, dust, and the silent negotiations between metal and air. Thought itself begins to behave like a decaying material.\nDuty Cycle is stillness weaponized. Zen filtered through structural decay. A drone record that does not move forward, but inward, toward a permanent state of slow, beautiful disintegration.\nThese drones do not hypnotize by movement, but by immobility. They reduce the mind to a static component inside a larger failing system. Awareness becomes structural. Emotional response is replaced by load, pressure, tolerance. You do not listen to Duty Cycle so much as you are gradually calibrated by it.\nIndustrial traces surface only as residues. Ghost voltages. Subsonic maintenance signals echoing through abandoned conduits. No aggression, no catharsis. Only the soft violence of endless operation. A loop without climax. A process that continues because stopping was never specified.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Sir Kuliktavikt steps into the ether with the first volume of Echøveil, a monthly radio apparition. Not so much a “show” as a shifting corridor of sound, where genres slip out of their cages and dissolve into luminous smoke. Expect a delirium of textures—psychedelic avant-rock, weird psych, dub-tribal techno, dream folk, musique concrète, dreamy dungeon synth, harsh noise, shoegaze, raw black metal, sound collage, no wave, progressive rock, soul, trippy Tropicália, anatolian rock, ghostly drones. My tastes fracture like mirrors, and each month I will serve a new banquet: sometimes serene, sometimes vertiginous, always trembling with uncanny light.\nEvery transmission is also haunted by a guest. Each episode closes with a mix from a sound-artist I revere, a voice I carry like a secret talisman. For this inaugural broadcast (September, released October 1st, because time never behaves), I have the honour of presenting a spectral mix by the brilliant Séraphitüs-Séraphîta—visionary, genius, dear friend.\nAnd more than sound: the entire visual body of Echøveil is conjured by Séraphitüs-Séraphîta. Their artwork—logos, banners, cover-images—feels like sigils dredged from submerged dreams: letters stretched into runes, veils of oceanic texture, shadow-webs that look alive, as if spun by invisible hands. These images do not simply accompany the sounds—they are part of the transmission itself, echoing on the edge of vision the same way music echoes in the ear.\nThis is only the beginning. Each month, another guest will pass through, another glyph will unfurl, another voice will warp the silence. Step into the veil, and lose yourself in its shifting corridors.\nPlease check Blacksmith Noise Records, the FANTASTIC netlabel managed by Séraphitüs-Séraphîta and Saint Elisabeth\nseraphitus-seraphita.bandcamp.com\nblacksmithnoiserecords.bandcamp.com",

A voice — yours, mine, ours — spirals through the ruinous frequencies.\nSir Kuliktavikt, esteemed curator of ghost transmissions, unseals the second chamber of ECHØVEIL RADIO — tonight steeped in a phosphorescent decay, a Halloween not of this Earth.\nNo pumpkins smiling politely. No plastic fangs. No jingling skeletons from the dollar store.\nOnly the mad hum of dying machines, the wet pulse of the grave, the inverted carnival behind your eyelids.\nAnd in the heart of this broadcast — Hystalgia emerges, veiled in amber hallucination.\nKnown for his transcendent project Flowering Shrubs — that strange garden where Freak Folk and Atmospheric Raw Black Metal entwine like two serpents in dream.\nWhere Hypnagogic Pop melts into rain-soaked tape hiss, where Outsider hymns stumble through fog, barefoot and luminous.\nWhere a broken acoustic guitar hums beside a dying synthesizer, both singing of childhood, decay, and forbidden light.\nThe Shrubs bloom in strange colors — pink noise, amber silence, spectral greens never meant for human eyes.\nTonight, the radio becomes a séance.\nA delirious carousel of lo-fi psych, musique concrète, horrorcore, and mouldy drone.\nFragments of Giallo soundtracks drift through cryptic tunnels of reverb.\nA crazy, demented organ screams hymns to the moon.\nDungeon noise and death rock slither beneath the floorboards.\nPumpkin synths wobble like diseased lanterns.\nYou may even hear your own breath, looping back through the static.\nThis is not your grandfather’s Halloween.\nThis is the Halloween that never was.\nThe one buried under static, still whispering in the soil, humming lullabies for the deranged.\nECHØVEIL RADIO\nEpisode II // DOS // DEUX // TwO \\\\ pedi\nTune in — if you dare — and let the transmission flood your skull with ghosts.\nAs always, eternal thanks to my friend Séraphitüs-Séraphîta for the artwork.\nAnd shout out to Hystalgia, one of my musical heroes. Let’s make this happen again and again !",

            "about": "ECHØVEIL RADIO // VOLUME III — WITH SPECTRE HORSEMEN, PALE WITH DUST !!!!\nBehold, wandering listeners of the brume-saturated night… Volume III of ECHØVEIL’s Radiophonic Experiment slithers out of its chrysalis of static and delirium, dripping with iridescent spores and questionable benevolence. Sir Kuliktavikt, still possessed by seventeen incompatible dream-spirits and one extremely confused radio antenna, returns to feed your trembling ears a banquet of styles stitched together with occult dental floss.\nTonight, the frequencies buckle and bloom:\nghostly psych-dream folk whispering in your fourth eyelid;\nminimalist ambient noise wall chiselling slow cosmic graffiti on your skull;\nfree-spiritual jazz spiralling up into dimensions only recently legalized;\nblack ambient gnawing the enamel of your sanity;\nold-school drone floating like a dead saint in colloidal light;\ndizzying avant-prog pirouetting on a broken tibia;\nexperimental rock exhaling fungal riddles;\npiano notes desolate enough to make angels cough;\nEthiopian jazz-funk shimmering like a ghost discothèque under the bed;\nfrozen dungeon synth shivering in chainmail reverie;\nand yes — a microscopic, rebellious wink of calypso, because even nightmares need a sunburn.\nAnd descending through the vapour, our honored guest materializes: Spectre Horsemen, Pale With Dust — an experimental sonic entity first spotted in October 2023. His sound merges dark ambient, post-industrial murmurs, doom-jazz exhales, drone incantations, power-electronics ruptures, and noise mutations… recombined into a haunted architecture that feels like a cathedral built inside an abandoned ribcage. Truly singular. Truly nightmarish. Truly wonderful.\nIf you dare, wander through his lair:\nspectrehorsemenpalewithdust.bandcamp.com\nTune in, tune out, tune sideways — the radio is alive, and it’s hungry.",

            "about": "ECHØVEIL RADIO // VOLUME IV — WITH OLD MOTH DREAMS !!!!\nHello, or good evening, dear travelers of the strange and uncharted sonic underworlds.\nThe hour has come for the fourth transmission of ECHØVEIL RADIO, the station that unsettles well-behaved children and the ill-behaved ones too.\nFor this fourth episode, drenched in impossible colors fallen straight from the sky, we have the distinct honor of welcoming Old Moth Dreams as our guest. An experimental, noisy, psychedelic dungeon synth project, wildly variegated and proudly unclassifiable. Hailing from Rhode Island, Old Moth Dreams delivers a body of work that is utterly singular: free-roaming, unhinged, nightmarish, and strangely marvelous. Within its labyrinth you will catch surreal refractions of avant-progressive rock, neo-classical shadows, darkwave reveries, progressive electronics, dark ambient vapors, and doom metal gravity.\nPlease do check out his amazing bandcamp right here:\noldmothdreams.bandcamp.com/music\nOur Rhode Island sound alchemist has curated a selection that mirrors their own mutating identity: radically diverse and joyfully unfaithful to genre borders. Expect experimental rock, old-school industrial relics, krautrock propulsion, cracked-voiced singers, satanic metal incursions, ethio-jazz detours, minimalist classical spells, and maestro Morricone at his most dungeon-synth-licious.\nOn my side of the altar, I bring you the usual scattered offerings: musique concrète, Indeterminacy, Latin synth-pop hallucinations, Japanese noise-psych-rock eruptions, no wave abrasion, avant-rock contortions, RIO mutations, experimental noise, Italian chanson ghosts, euphoric rap fragments, early electronic circuitry, and other playful psychédelic misbehaviors.\nFinal episode of 2025.\nAnd I look forward to meeting you again in 2026, with more sumptuous and unexpected guests lurking just beyond the static.",

            "about": "ECHØVEIL RADIO // VOLUME V — WITH PARANOISED !!!!\nThe radio coughed. The dial bled. Episode V of ECHØVEIL Radio clawed its way out of the receiver, smelling faintly of ozone, dust, and forgotten tapes left too long in overheated cars. The experiment continued. The experiment intensified. The experiment briefly stared back at you and smiled.\nThis time, the transmission bent inward, collapsing into itself like a Möbius strip made of corrupted reels. Our guest apparition: Paranoised, alone with his archives, his ghosts, his innumerable parallel selves. No curation. No compromise. No outside contamination. A mixtape composed exclusively of his own personal tracks, exhumed from the deep strata of his sonic memory. Surrealist noise drifting like radioactive fog. Musique concrète warped into obscene shapes. Anti-music of the highest caliber, gnawing at structure, mocking coherence, celebrating glorious malfunction. Sound as residue. Sound as obsession. Sound as a deliberate wrong turn taken at full speed.\nBTW, please investigate his Bandcamp. You’ll never be the same (and that’s not a bad thing):\nparanoised.bandcamp.com/music\nMeanwhile, Sir Kuliktavikt, still technically hosting but spiritually elsewhere, scattered his selections across time, geography, and reason. Italian prog-rock blooming with baroque excess. A single Renaissance gem, intact, gleaming, quietly defiant against the centuries. Minimal ambient noise stretched thin as frost. Psychedelic folk murmuring pastoral hallucinations. Hypnagogic rock-pop drifting between sleep paralysis and soft neon nostalgia. Contemporary classical exploding in over-the-top gestures, orchestral vertigo barely contained. Lo-fi Japanese blues-dirges rasping like damaged memories. African psych-jazz spiralling in heat and dust. MPB glowing with bittersweet melancholy. Ultra-weird, spectral library music creeping like background radiation. Romantic Raw Black Metal buzzing with impossible bees. Free jazz unfolding in a slow, zen-like suspension, breath and space doing the heavy lifting. And finally, a krautrock nocturne by Cluster, calm, serene, motorik reduced to a pulse barely disturbing the night air.\nNo genre loyalty. No safety rails. Just an ecstatic constellation of sounds, eras, intentions and beautiful mistakes.\nTune in. Get lost. Forget what radio was supposed to be.\nEnjoy.",

            "about": "ECHØVEIL RADIO VI drifts in like a fever remembered by the body but not the mind. A nocturnal broadcast stitched from borrowed hours, cracked shellac dreams, scorched tape, devotional noise, jazz ghosts still sweating incense, and pop melodies that have forgotten their own faces.\nSir Kuliktavikt opens the séance with a cartography of beautiful disorientation. Ancient psych-prog hallucinations brush against raw black metal, dubwise murmurs, and musique concrète tantrums. Live Fahey fills the room with despair and joy in equal measure. Sun Ra splits the sky into twin stars while Henry Cowell claws the inside of the piano like an animal trapped in folklore. Darkthrone exhales a wind of sorrow, then Vince Guaraldi smiles briefly through the smoke, as if nothing terrible ever happened. Nihilism dances. Love songs rot tenderly. Machines rehearse joy. Folk music sleeps with ghosts. Everything bleeds into everything else, and somehow the wound sings.\nThis episode wanders without a map, slipping from jazz cellars to lunar temples, from minimalist mountain air to television static soaked in grief. Each track is a door left ajar. Each silence a threat. A playlist behaving like a half-remembered childhood, where cartoon melodies coexist with death, tenderness with ulcers, ecstasy with dental drills.\nThen, my friend, the noise auteur Saint Elisabeth arrives to take over the airwaves. His mixtape unfolds like a reliquary smashed on concrete. Miles Davis whispers to Coltrane through walls of time. Basinski lets decay speak its true language. Burroughs mutters spells directly into the tape hiss. Alice Coltrane ascends. Ahab drags the ocean into the room. Sonic Youth trembles. Patti Smith elegizes the air itself. Saint Elisabeth’s church is built on freedom, sonic jubilation, cunning euphonious devastation, and copious amounts of FUNK-KOSMIGROOVE (oh yes) and experimental avant-noise.\nTune in and hear radio as it should be broadcast.",

            "about": "With echostrial noisoveil, RDKPL descends into a fractured industrial dreamspace where sound behaves like unstable matter. Across three dense compositions, abstract glitch eruptions, corroded noise strata and musique concrète debris grind against each other in slow, deliberate tension. Percussive shapes emerge and collapse like malfunctioning machinery heard through fog, while deconstructed electronics stutter, scrape and pulse with a strange, almost ritual insistence.\nNothing here seeks resolution or comfort. Instead, echostrial noisoveil unfolds as a series of sonic experiments conducted in darkness, where echoes multiply, rhythms rot, and textures reveal hidden architectures beneath their surface violence. It is harsh yet precise, oppressive yet deeply absorbing: a work that rewards attentive listening, inviting the listener to wander inside its broken mechanisms and ghostly reverberations.\nA stark and fascinating release, echostrial noisoveil stands as one of RDKPL’s most compelling explorations of abstract industrial noise, perfectly aligned with ECHØVEIL’s fascination for sound as shadow, residue, and altered perception.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Ethereal K-Pop Noise by Buenos Aires sound-alchemist pinkhydrangea arrives like a clandestine meteor of sweetness and distortion, a strange blossom blooming inside your ribcage. Few records this year have radiated such dangerous beauty. Each track pulls you beneath successive tides of shimmering rose-vermilion ecstasy, torrents of glittering night-juice that flare and flare and flare again inside the sibylline dark. It feels like being carried by tornados of glass-dust splendor: they trace the spine with tenderness while carving luminous faultlines across the skin.\nEnchanting K-Pop vapor rises through vertiginous noise-ambient cyclones, forming a union so improbable it should collapse under its own delirium, yet instead it sings, perfectly. Violent Dream Pop. Though the violence is the benevolent kind, the sort that leaves your face bloodied but your heart hammering in euphoric devotion. Like falling off your skateboard while on shrooms, breaking all the bones in your body while the SUN BLOOMS INTO SUPERNOVA above you. Stars collide. Candied-psych-lychee-kawaii-knife-oolong storms whirl around your thoughts. Bliss with fangs.\nA sonic budae jjigae for the soul: molten, spicy, comforting, deranged, alive.\nA record that hurts in precisely the way you needed. A record that heals by breaking you open.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "It begins in the filled void.\nNot emptiness. Saturation. A thickness that growls, twists, sweats. Cosmic Fumes opens the wound again, but deeper this time. The ground has collapsed into a vast scar-lake, slow-boiling at the edge of a burned forest that still exhales its last heat. Nothing moves, yet everything churns.\nBodies remain. Half-charred, half-warped, slipping into the black slurry. Ash-mud. Post-human sediment. They do not disappear. They soften. They merge. The lake absorbs without urgency.\nThe sound holds.\nA minimal mass, nearly static, but internally restless. Low frequencies knead themselves. Small ruptures form and reseal. Orientation dissolves. There is no outside, no perimeter, only this trembling density. From within it, something vocal emerges. Not language. Not quite sound. A thin, distant keening. The void, learning how to call.\nIt pulls.\nSoftly. Constantly. It whispers in mud, in rot, in slow suction. The world has become a burned wound that will not close. Cosmic Fumes stretches this state to its limit, until even terror stabilizes, until fear itself becomes calm, stripped, declarative. A final utterance, bare and resigned.\nThen nothing changes.\nBut everything has shifted.\nUgUrGkuliktavikt does not enter. It condenses.\nA fog settles over the same scene, thick, particulate, almost granular. Atomic dust falls without weight, coating the lake, the bodies, the skeletal remains of the forest. Time has passed, or failed to pass. Growth appears, but incorrectly. Pale, diseased sprouts push through the fouled ground, hesitant, already decaying.\nAbove, no sun. No moon.\nA sphere.\nNot luminous. Not dark. A pressure suspended in the sky. A closed system of suffering, radiating without light. A sun of exhaustion. Hope extinguished long before it could be named.\nFigures gather.\nHumanoid only by approximation. Hooded, bent, incomplete. Anti-priests orbit the lake, drawn to it without understanding. They kneel before stones, before water, before fragments of bone. Their gestures are devotional but broken. Hands brushing the soil. Fingers tracing nothing. Mouths leaking murmurs that never assemble into meaning.\nThey plead, but not for salvation.\nFor continuation.\nTheir voices slip into wet laughter, into choking hymns, into low, animal repetitions. The lake answers with small movements. Surface tension shivers. Shapes suggest themselves beneath. Not emergence. Not presence. Just pressure, waiting.\nUgUrGkuliktavikt does not corrupt the landscape.\nIt confirms it.\nThe void is no longer a process. No longer an event. It is fixed. Absolute. The end not as conclusion, but as condition. No before. No after. Only this: a stagnant infinity, where decay has completed itself and continues anyway.\nThe fluttering persists.\nNot life. Not death.\nA residual trembling in the abyss, where something once tried to exist and failed without ever stopping.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "four variations on a theme of malice.\nImprovised and overdubbed synths recorded to tape during the last week of November at the Grey Haven, Bendalong.\n-Gogol\n---\nFour tracks. Four slow infections. Each one improvised in near-darkness, with flaws deliberately left to fester. Nothing here is polished or corrected. The hiss remains. The wobble persists. The atmosphere is allowed to rot naturally.\nThe tools were modest and worn. A second-hand Roland Boutique SH-01A, freshly acquired and still unfamiliar in the hands. A delay unit smearing time into itself. A loop pedal gnawing at fragments. A four-track tape recorder quietly bleeding its ghosts into the signal. These machines were set loose inside a small, isolated house buried in the bush on the south coast of New South Wales.\nThat week, the land was hostile. Cold rain. Grey skies that never fully lifted. The bush no longer felt neutral. It loomed. It watched. Gogol treated the forest not as scenery, but as a mirror. A place where the malice embedded in human history seeps back into soil and bark. Colonisation. Erasure. Genocide. These thoughts are impossible to silence when walking through Australian bushland. The land remembers, even when the present pretends not to.\nEach track unfolds like a cautious walk between trees that know more than they should. Sounds creep rather than advance. Melodies form before collapsing back into shadow. The past leaks through every sustained note, heavy and unresolved.\nThe night is cold. The rain does not absolve anything. The elements keep their records.\nMinimalist, hushed, and deeply malignant, four strains is a small but devastating document of quiet menace.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

Edited and produced exclusively on a Roland SP-404MKII.\n-Yienksa\n---\nRio de Janeiro, February 11–24, 2025.\nFragments lifted, not taken. Air, dust, passing currents.\nVoices speaking, chanting, unfastened from their mouths.\nThey warp, fold, return as something thinner than breath. Aether, or its residue.\nKalimba. Caxixi.\nSmall constellations trembling in the light. Sparse, deliberate, almost secret.\nEverything else: the city, half-erased, still pulsing beneath the surface.\nA living, breathing organism of sound, already forgetting its own shape.\nMemories disintegrating into dreams.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "*Gyotaku is a Japanese art form that involves reproducing fish impressions on various surfaces, such as paper or fabric.\n---\nMaquereau Dose resurfaces after its first surreal, abrasive sonic misdeed, still trailing psychotropic fumes and scorched echoes. With Gyotaku II, the Montreal-based duo deepens the incision. What emerges is a jubilant, syncopated collision of obsessions: guitar drone stretched into ceremonial lengths, contemporary music swollen into something ancestral and ritual-bound, fuzz-soaked proto–noise rock, lunar and half-spoiled proto-ambient, dada loosened at the seams, free-improv post-rock with the brakes cut and the wheel still spinning.\nEverything feels deliciously misaligned. Vast yet hidden. A secret whispered directly into the inner ear by a fog-born entity, indulgent and unclean, some impious god drifting through vaporous Amethyst seas. The music breathes like a slow tide, eroding structure, polishing dissonance into something strangely tender.\nListening feels like eavesdropping on an interstellar jam where the Taj Mahal Travellers tune their ghosts alongside Barrett-era Pink Floyd, Les Rallizes Dénudés, early Sonic Youth, Yellow Swans, Birchville Cat Motel, Loren Mazzacane Connors, and Fushitsusha. Not imitation, but shared gravity. A gathering point where sound forgets its century and remembers something older.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Hospice : Noun\n1 : an inn for travelers\nespecially : one kept by a religious order\n2 : a place or program for caring for dying persons\n“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted”\nMatthew 5 : 4\nThese are sounds that I cannot quite explain, except that I was compelled to create them. Vague memories, flashes. Abstractions. Dedicated to those who mourn. Love.\n* There is no Track I\nThis is a bit of a departure for Saint Elisabeth, and I hope you’ll take the time to listen to the piece as a whole. Hospice was very much intended to be one long sound. Thank you all for your support, it carries me.\n-Saint Elisabeth\n---\nHospice by sound artist Saint-Elisabeth is a work reduced to the marrow. Beautiful and minimal, noisy yet ambient, it breathes with a fragile, restrained gravity. This release marks the second issue in ECHØVEIL’s series devoted to the back catalogue of Saint-Elisabeth, which I strongly encourage you to explore in full. It is all essential, all deeply worthwhile:\nsaintelisabeth.bandcamp.com\nWhat remains here is stripped of aggression, stripped of nightmare. Only residual dust from dark ambient traditions lingers, eroded until compassion becomes the dominant frequency. Ancient, unresolved regret drifts through these pieces like incense in an abandoned chapel. The music feels suspended between states, hovering in an uncertain corridor between the world of the living and the world of the dying, unsure of where the soul might finally come to rest.\nHospice unfolds as a space of supreme recollection and quiet mourning. Blurred memories surface and dissolve, melancholy is sublimated into texture, and silence itself becomes an active presence. The atmosphere is solemn and fascinating, grief-stricken yet strangely tender, always held in suspension. It is beautiful, tragic, and deeply humane. A work of rare restraint and profound emotional ambiguity.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "The house stood there, menacing with its long, dark shadows deeply cast, tragic history lining its inhuman face. How many sorrowful lives had it claimed in its long life? How many poor souls forever lost inside its bloodstained and tear soaked walls, trapped now, forever tenants haunting its unhallowed halls?\n\"Lots of books have been written about houses of the damned. The bagheria villa of monsters, near palermo, the house of peacocks in Brussels, the Salamander Maison in France. \" - E. Varelli\n\"The house did not shelter. It devoured. \" - Malachai Blackthorn\n\"These structures were built with the assistance of black magic, and thus they remain as haunted dwellings until the end of time\". - E.Varelli\n---\nRags Ov Light returns to ECHØVEIL RECORDS with Houses of the Damned, a brief yet bottomless descent into the trembling half-world where dust remembers what the living have forgotten.\nThree spectral invocations, three atmospheric dungeon-synth lamentations drifting at the threshold of noctambulant ambient — each one a candle guttering in a corridor that barely exists.\nThese are hymns for the ruined houses: collapsed porches and sighing attics, soaked walls eroding grain by grain under the endless rain. Within them wander the weary spirits, exhausted by centuries of pleading, still murmuring their broken questions into the fog. Their despair curls like incense through the air, yet Rags Ov Light shapes it into something strangely warm, strangely cold — a paradoxical glow in the mausoleum of abandonment.\nMinimalist keyboards trace the contours of forgotten rooms, of staircases that dream of ascent, of foundations gnawed by mold and memory. Through these tones, we are invited to inhabit the eyes of the withered and the sorrow-stricken — the ones who linger at the edge of unreality, unsure of why they stayed, unsure of where the door ever was.\nHouses of the Damned is a miniature requiem for all structures that outlived their tenants, a fragile shard of hope buried inside centuries of melancholic drift.\nA sublime short album from one of the most haunting visionaries working in the realm today.",

            "about": "Charred flesh corridors collapsed around my stripped carcass.\nVisions from a forbidden elsewhere filled the inside of my sight.\nEyes.\nEverywhere.\nOn my face, my brow, my chest, my legs.\nBreeding. Watching. Sick with reason undone.\nThe corridors died.\nAn echo remained.\nA city that was always abandoned.\nHouses confessed by screaming obsolete prayers.\nWindows became cleavers, vomiting grey, rancid meat.\nThe streets were split open by something older than memory.\nFrom the cracks came black light. Croaking corpses.\nAnd something else.\nUnexplainable. It moves.\nI wept coal from every opening in my body.\nDead night coupled with spoiled day.\nThey tore each other open. Fed. Bled.\nThey made a permanent dusk, red, crawling.\nThe sky refused its own color.\nBuildings rotted under purple disease.\nInside: rituals without language.\nAnti-beings inviting ancient, malicious gods\nto wear them from the inside.\nEverything is rusted flesh.\nEvery lamppost holds a hanging dog’s head.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Sometimes, life quietly places an album in your hands that knocks the breath out of you. One you do not merely enjoy, but fall headfirst into. In love with its singular atmosphere, its deceptively simple yet finely wrought compositions, its intimate and enchanted inner world. Idle Hand is very much one of those rare encounters.\nAs a first full statement, this debut from Tucson, Arizona based experimental and cinematic dungeon and nature synth project FERAL CLAW feels almost unreal in its level of confidence and vision. It is the kind of arrival that suggests a path already mapped in secret, and hints at even stranger and more arresting territories ahead. This is a project to watch closely.\nFERAL CLAW weaves together classic dungeon synth, nature synth and fantasy synth with an almost uncanny ease, folding in field recordings and naturalistic samples that feel organic rather than ornamental. Nocturnal synthwave hues drift through the fog, introspective spoken word passages surface like half remembered thoughts, while ambient, dark ambient and analog horror textures seep into the cracks. A faint, surreal vaporwave shimmer lingers at the edges, just enough to warp the perspective.\nEach track exists as its own fragile and flourishing microcosm. Small worlds, carefully assembled, brimming with quiet wonder and melancholy. You wander through them willingly, gradually hypnotized by the creator’s gift for carving minimalist melodies that linger long after the sound has faded, emotional without excess, intimate without fragility.\nAnd then there is the final piece. Nearly twenty minutes long, it unfolds as a truly staggering sonic voyage. A place where getting lost feels like the entire point. Chimera like, nocturnal, dream soaked and hypnagogic, it evokes a kind of faded cinematic New Age. Darker, stranger, more suggestive. At moments, it even recalls the most atmospheric and haunted corners of Boards of Canada. A small masterpiece in itself, one that reveals its full depth when experienced alongside the beautiful accompanying story.\nThis is an album to inhabit, not simply to hear.\nYou are strongly encouraged to read the accompanying narrative while listening:\nferalclaw.com/a-spectral-guide/f/a-spectral-guide\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "now like sleep collapsing into static—\nthe soft hiss between thoughts—\nthe TV’s ghost channel hums something half-remembered,\na wordless weather of fatigue.\nwhite on white on white—\nthe sky buffering,\nthe mind lagging—\npixels of yesterday dissolving into soft blizzards of dust-memory.\nprocrastination drips, viscous, from the ceiling of time.\ni try to move but my limbs are delayed transmissions,\nfeedback loops of maybe-later, maybe-never.\nsomewhere far, a voice made of snowblind vowels murmurs\nwake up or go back to sleep—\ni can’t tell which channel it’s on.\nthe soul is greyscale,\nstretched thin over the endless hum,\nan old tape played until the oxide flakes off.\nnothing remains but the sigh of a dying frequency,\na shimmer of almost-recognition,\ndissolving into the infinite nap of light.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "The ninth wound. The ninth transmission. The machine mutters and folds into itself — sparks dripping like black honey. Paranoised digs into the nerve of the thing, that zone where electricity dreams of bone. Somewhere between a corpse-painted Delia Derbyshire humming in the dark and Les Légions Noires conducting séances through tape recorders.\nA KPM library record from a reality too warped to exist, playing on a melted turntable orbiting a dead planet. Varèse reassembled from rust and plasma, reborn as Tetsuo’s final spasmodic form under the cracked hand of a deranged Tesla, his assistant Ligotti feeding static into the wound.\nIX sounds like a Game Boy haunted by multiple entities, like the ghost of sound trying to find a shape — all feedback, chrome, pulse, collapse. A place where UFOs dissolve into their own signal, and the night eats the night again.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "We share our culture when we share sounds. We work together. And you?\n-KommandOOverdose & I,Eternal\n---\nThis album is a fall that never learns.\nA transatlantic collision between KommandOOverdose (Québec) and I, Eternal (France), two severely damaged sound architects stitching their respective insanities into a single unstable mass. What unfolds is not a collaboration but a shared delirium, a mutual infection engineered for listeners who crave vertigo, abrasion, and the pleasure of being dismantled.\nListening feels like standing atop a hallucinated mountain, toes curling over the edge. You fall. You land somewhere worse. The ground is oily and pulsating, beating like an electric heart. Above, an ash-choked sky. Around you, passing spectres with syringe-arms knitting top hats from human flesh, their eye sockets empty because the eyes are elsewhere. Hundreds of them. Floating. Watching. Inspecting. Dissecting. Some melt like Dalí clocks. Others collapse inward, becoming screaming black holes.\nImpossible sounds drip into carbonized matter. Spoiled starlight flows upward in a reversed cascade. Another fall. And another. Each impact fractures you further, and somehow your face splits into a grotesque grin, taped together, skin cracked, torn, cheekbones exposed to the air. The sky turns psychedelic fuchsia. Bats descend to gnaw at you, rattling extraterrestrial noisemakers with their wings.\nExquisite corpses, taken literally. Cadavers dipped in hollandaise sauce. Fingers especially crispy.\nYou wander deeper into an ever-thickening sonic vapor. Electrical wires perform a danse macabre, coiling lovingly around your decomposing shell, moaning with pleasure. Another fall. A damp dungeon. One light only. A single electric globe glued to the ceiling. Blood seeps inside it. No exit. Just tiny holes in the walls. From one hole, an ear drops, still twitching. Then the spiders come. From all the holes. Thousands. Millions.\nThe globe laughs and explodes in a spray of blood.\nSpiders cover your skin. You bleed. You laugh. They crawl into your eyes.\nYour eyes.\nYours ; yes.\nYOUR EYES.\nThis record does not want to be understood. It wants to keep falling with you.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Lacridronesa is a Requiem Drone Mass (a drone composition for the dead). Deconstructed classical samples unravel and form ambient noise walls that maintain the sorrowful, mournful character of their provenance. If you listen closely enough, you might catch choral fragments of the original samples breaking through.\nVolume I includes a wintery, dark ambient selection of four movements honoring the life and work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, released on the 234th anniversary of his death.\n-Séraphitüs-Séraphîta\n═══════════════════════════════════════\nRequiem æternam dona eis, Dómine.\nEt lux perpétua lúceat eis.\nFidélium ánimæ, per misericórdiam Dei, requiéscant in pace.\nAmen.\n═══════════════════════════════════════\nLacridronesa is the latest funereal offering from the multidisciplinary visionary Séraphitüs-Séraphîta—a Requiem-Mass transmuted into drone, into wounded resonance, into a trembling procession of tones wandering through unnameable fogs and the brittle oubliettes of the centuries.\nHere, the wind itself becomes cantor: carrying its regrets across extinct fields, scattering the dried, death-tinged sobs of time—time, that pitiless weight grinding all memory into pale dust. Across these four inconsolable drone-laments, beauty persists like an eternal solitude: hypnotic, bent under the invisible burden of vanished days, spiralling through a night that twists upon a sky rusted with old bitterness.\nMemory, regret, joy, sorrow, triumph, defeat—everything unthreads itself with slow majesty. Everything dislocates in a perpetual waltz of the dead, beneath the ancient ashen vapors of a millennial mist. All returns to dust, to origins. Even the most sumptuous classical works become shards of forgetting in the cemetery of our drifting lives—common graves of impossible glass.\nLacridronesa is a meditation on dissolution, a vigil held in the ruins of remembrance. A work where every resonance feels anointed with the cold incense of destiny, as though we were all gently chloroformed by the stigmata of our own becoming.\nA requiem for the things we loved, for the things we lost, for the things we could never name.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "\"Le Marécage aux Secrets Hermétiques\" is the new offering from UgUrGkuliktavikt — an exploration of what “new age” music might become once filtered through a haunted mind, where healing tones are veined with shadows, and harsh noise lurks just beneath the moss.\nThis swamp is neither comforting nor threatening: it pulses with an ancient ambivalence, a haze of hesitant fog and deceptive paths. You move through it as though wandering inside a dream unsure whether it wants to soothe you or swallow you whole.\nThrough the drifting vapors, electric faeries flicker, strange creatures shift their weight in the mud, and their distant, warped cries weave a crooked liturgy.\nIt is an imaginary ecosystem where nature breathes sideways, where sound mutates in the mist, where gentleness and dread dissolve into one another.\nA spectral new age, muddied and shimmering, guided by a trembling inner light.\nWelcome to the swamp.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "\"Les hilarants halls du Château UGZykBriJjvNaukorG\" is a document that should not exist in this form.\nA rework, yes, but also a spatial anomaly.\nRooms repeat without symmetry. Hallways elongate mid-listening. Laughter collapses into pressure, then into absence. Sound behaves like an infected document: footnotes that whisper, margins that breathe, frequencies that relocate when not observed.\nI,Eternal did not rework the album so much as submit it to non-Euclidean protocols, splicing its corpus through hypnagogic machinery and forbidden archival noise. What emerges is a ghost architecture, assembled from drone, residue, and mnemonic corrosion.\nThese are sick soundscapes ; this is decadent and ghoulish doom-ambient.\nThe halls are still laughing. They are hungrier than before. And now, they see through you.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Raw black metal, feral and incandescent with a sickly glow. It exults while it crushes. A celestial rot spreads through worlds and anti-worlds alike, flaking into dark ambient dust, entangled with dungeon synth carcasses and corroded metallic residue.\nEverything trembles in lo-fi grandeur. Tape hiss like dying lungs. Unfathomable chasms opening beneath skeletal melodies. A dream gasps its last breath and collapses inward, birthing the nightmare directly inside the abyss. Cold vertigo. Furious contemplation.\nThe vocals are not sung but exhumed. Lysergic echoes tearing through burial soil. Keyboards spill schizophrenic torrents across a surreal wasteland where nothing lives, yet everything persists in decomposition.\nIt is brief. It leaves wounds that itch.\nAnd still, something inside begs to return. Again. Again.\nOur emptied souls wander willingly into this supernatural cosmogony, circling the coffin, listening for movement within.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

Alone, you face the storm, swallowed entirely… You let yourself be battered and cradled by the alien howls of this unholy wind. And damn… it feels absolutely incredible.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A journey back into an earlier, demented artefact from the vast and uncompromising discography of the Canadian sound sorcerer Phibes Praetorius.\nHere, the occult sonic alchemist turns his attention to the myth of the Wendigo: a malevolent spirit of Algonquian folklore, a skeletal giant with a heart of ice, embodiment of hunger, greed, and cannibalism. Associated with winter, famine, and the decay of the human soul, it possesses or transforms humans who have tasted human flesh, turning them into ravenous monsters. A warning woven into the marrow of morality, explored across literature and dark popular imagination.\nThrough disoriented, labyrinthine tracks, Phibes Praetorius drags the listener across frozen landscapes corrupted by malevolent spirits, coaxing the human mind to indulge its basest instincts. Dark ambient pulses shiver like frostbitten veins; haunted plunderphonics unravel like spectral tape loops; ritualistic deliriums smolder hypnotically, corrosively; documentary fragments and cryptic film samples twist into fractured visions; concrete music splinters into schizophrenic false paths—all coalescing under the clawed hands of a masterful, ruthless sonic manipulator, always lurking where least expected.\nThis is horror. This is ritual. This is exquisite, experimental sonic art.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Tape sounds inspired by dilapidated churches, the midwest, isolated religious communities, loons, the 1970’s, solo organ performances of hymnals and the color green.\n---\nUnder the name Seinnid, Maine-based sound artist Jake Smith offers a profoundly haunted work of tape music, a small obtuse miracle, humble and strangely devastating. This is music that seems to arrive already aged, already eroded, as if unearthed rather than composed. Echoes of The Caretaker, William Basinski or Fennesz drift through its corridors, not as references but as distant relatives, silhouettes glimpsed through fogged glass.\nFaded religious hymns hover like half-forgotten prayers. Yellowed polaroids tremble in the air, their subjects dissolving as you try to recognize them. Ambient organ tones are kneaded and stretched until they buckle under their own weight, collapsing beautifully, reverently. Ballroom jazz ghosts stagger and melt, once-crowded rooms turning into approximate ambient swamps, warped and tender. Everything here feels suspended between grace and decay, between memory and the slow erasure of being itself.\nThis is not nostalgia as comfort, but nostalgia as vertigo. A record that listens to itself disappearing. A record that haunts you as you haunt yourself.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "abandoned keys / insect choirs /\nthe city sleeps, but the piano still breathes through the dust.\nits veins are cracked ivory, its lungs full of wind and asphalt.\na cyclist passes — metallic heartbeat.\na hammer falls — inside the dream of a construction site.\ngrasshoppers click their coded hymns,\ncommunicating with frequencies the human ear refuses to name.\nthirty-seven fragments, each one a broken syllable from the same haunted mouth.\nthe piano doesn’t play music anymore — it performs autopsies of silence.\nit mutters in percussive tongues,\nit coughs in feedback,\nit scratches itself against the thin membrane between now and before.\nthese are songs for a world where instruments remember being trees,\nwhere strings vibrate like radio wires under the skin of a fevered sky,\nwhere each sound is both bone and echo, both ritual and malfunction.\nif Forks, Strings and Birds was the gentle implosion of melody,\nthen More Strings and Grasshoppers is the fever after the implosion —\na delirium of rhythm,\na swarm of microscopic dances,\na trance for the rusted gods of Montreal’s roadside ruins.\nthe hammer hits, the air trembles.\nno one conducts.\nthe piano convulses, and the world listens through its cracks.\n[the echo remains.]\n[the grasshoppers keep time.]\n[the city dissolves into the reverb.]\n↯ ↯ ↯\nsound returns as dust.\nand dust remembers as it dissolves.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",
            "credits": "released January 11, 2026\nAll tracks were recorded on an abandoned piano found by the roadside in Montreal. Grasshoppers, cyclists, and construction noises were captured at the same time. This EP is an unplanned follow-up to Forks, strings and birds, born from another encounter with a forgotten piano.\nmusiquemoleculaire.bandcamp.com/album/forks-strings-and-birds\nOne piece from this album was broadcast on the New Music Show on BBC Radio 3. I appreciated the announcer’s delivery when describing the album, so I included a brief excerpt as an introduction. The text remains the property of its original author and broadcaster.'\n-Yienksa\n---\nRecorded, Edited, mixed and produced entirely with an SP-404- mk2 by Yienksa.\nyienksa.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Nest is an illusion of shelter.\nA womb of plush, psychedelic textures. Soft. Enveloping. Almost kind.\nYou lie curled inside it, pressed against walls made of confused noise and swollen dreams. Sounds breathe. Pulse. Repeat. Hypnotic, obsessive, pharamineous. A cocoon dream. A refuge stitched from warmth and disorientation.\nToo late, you understand.\nIt is not a nest.\nIt is a web.\nThe spider arrives with ceremonial patience. Vast beyond proportion. Eyes cold and cosmic, reflecting geometries that should not exist. Hairy legs slick with hemlock, brushing gently as they close in. A crystalline body, surreal, faceted, bent at impossible angles. A visitor from elsewhere. From flaccid, unreasoning dimensions.\nThe dream curdles.\nEverything turns red.\nRed-black-red-crimson.\nThoughts collide and rupture, invaded by hallucinogenic venom. Time softens. Identity frays. As the body is devoured, slowly, tenderly, an obscene ecstasy blooms. Bones crushed. Blood flowing with syrupy calm. A smile frozen at the corner of the mouth. Mandibles tearing cheeks with surgical devotion.\nAnd beneath the horror, a secret peace.\nThe soul loosens its grip. It evaporates like water becoming vapor. Dissolving. Feeding the web. Feeding the thing. Feeding the chaos.\nTo be consumed is to belong.\nTo belong is to disappear.\nTo disappear is to become the chaos itself.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Three hours of dark ambient drone devoted to three fragrant flowers that bloom at night: Sweet Alyssum (Lobularia maritima), Evening Primrose (Oenothera), & Moonflower (Ipomoea alba). A gentle unraveling beneath the moon... Layered and lightly noisy with resonance.\nThings start loud and dense on [𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐦 𝐈-𝐈𝐈] and begin to subtly lift on [𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐈-𝐈𝐈]. They're then followed by a softening, quieting, and an airier energy in the second half with the 𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 selections — some of which even feel \"spacy,\" i.e., [𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐈𝐈-𝐈𝐕]. And by the time we arrive at [𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐕], it feels as though we've returned home... somewhere... 𓇢𓆸\n-Séraphitüs-Séraphîta\n---\nNIGHTBLOOM is a lunar herbarium, a hallucinated botany. A place where hours dissolve into fragrance, where sound opens its petals only once, and only in the dark.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "WinDGeisT, O Prophet of Vibrations Forgotten, who mumbles in cathedrals carved from silence, finally arrives on ECHØVEIL !\nThis is the expanded edition of the EP originally released on All Hallows’ Eve by the experimental dungeon synth artist emerging from Germany’s lightless forests.\nThree tracks of vampiric, ultra-atmospheric, surreal, nightmarish dungeon synth, infected throughout by black ambient seepage, as is customary for this somber lord of funereal echoes. These pieces exhume and reanimate the spectral afterimages of Murnau’s expressionist masterpiece, filtered through the forsaken inner visions of one of dungeon synth’s most singular and gifted soundscapers.\nAs a terminal appendix comes a remix, or rather a hostile reconfiguration: an ambient plunderphonics, dark ambient obliteration of the original material, reassembled into a single nineteen-minute trance by the known audio saboteur UgUrGkuliktavikt. Augmented with cries, ruptured screams, noise accretions, diseased keyboards, funeral piano, and stray sonic residues, the piece drags the album through a prolonged death-throes ritual.\nImagine Nosferatu unfolding inside Silent Hill, projected onto rotting walls, the film screaming back at the fog.\nHEADPHONES RECOMMENDED FOR FULL IMMERSION.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "An hour of droning, liminally themed dark ambient for when one wishes to fade into the deep and cease to exist for a time.\n-Errant Static\n---\nOf Darkness is the third work by the Utah-based noise alchemist Errant Static to surface through the cracked concrete floors of ECHØVEIL RECORDS. This time, the descent reaches backward, unearthing one of her early and most merciless artifacts, a piece that still exhales soot and old dread when disturbed.\nThis album is an ebony reliquary. A guided visit through the collapsed corridors of a long-abandoned subterranean mine, its supports eaten by time, its air thick with mineral ghosts and exhausted screams. It is also an extended stay in the basement of a dying asylum, where the walls are smeared with dried blood and a spongy, infectious madness that never quite hardened, never quite left.\nWhat unfolds is a slow procession through a blackness more absolute than absence itself. Drone coils and settles like a dormant beast, dark ambient hums and crackles, purring beneath strata upon strata of morbid, serpentine noise. The sound does not rush. It stalks. It seeps. It stains.\nThis is a work of soot, black laid upon black, until form becomes memory and memory becomes pressure. Somewhere, a single trembling light tries to persist, flickering weakly, already aware of its own extinction.\nOf Darkness does not offer catharsis. It offers solitude. A sealed environment where sound replaces walls and time dissolves into a viscous fog. The question is not whether you will find your way out, but whether you dare to remain, irreversibly alone, in these zones of sonic perdition, listening as the darkness slowly learns your name.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Somewhere between the last syllable and the drowning of the word itself, the ship kept sinking in reverse. A slow, blissful cataclysm — guitars like glass arteries bleeding vowels into black water. Time burns, not forward but inward. post-rock, post-breath, post-body. The sound forgets itself. A requiem for the concept of remembering.\nEverything is melting but so still, so immaculately still — the perfect entropy of saudade. A volcano dreaming of being a snowflake. A child’s laughter in a melted transistor, whispering coordinates of extinct emotions. frozen harmonica seep through the crust, gasping vowels that no longer exist. The sea hums in lowercase.\nDark-light, light-dark. both eyes closed. the music looks back.\nEach note a collapsing sunbeam, licking the skin of the abyss. Bliss becomes static. Static becomes prayer.\nThis is a shipwreck remembering its own birth.\nOverday — the word after dawn, before meaning.\nA sonic fossil of a night that never ended — that December night, when the sky turned orange and the railroad lifted, evaporated, whispered: we’re still here, under the voltage of time.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt\n-----\n\"Overday\" substitutes the standard antique piano of \"the microphone is 3 electric guitars\" for a more exotic \"air piano\" - also known as an old beat up accordion from the era when flights were divided into smoking and non-smoking - held together using a careful amalgamation of chopsticks, paperclips, and glue. Overday also includes some very low quality harmonica samples played by children, followed by said children laughing, screaming, crying, and something in-between and all-together for good measure.\n-the microphone is 3 electric guitars",

            "about": "Hymns extruded from a throat lined with rust. They arrive already decomposing, already slipping, each segment separated by microscopic wounds that leak duration instead of blood. Between them: pressure. Between them: a dizziness that chews through altitude, through bone.\nYou enter a grocery structure that recognizes you before you exist. Its walls pulse like opened musculature stretched over scaffolding. Refrigerated infinities hum behind veils of tendon. You point at something. It unwraps itself. It is meat, but it remembers language. It trembles in your hands, whispering frequencies that have no air to travel through.\nClocks are not measured here, they are cooked. Dial-faces blister over beds of incandescent thistle, barbed wire tightening like thought loops around their circumference. Time screams in thin metallic threads, then caramelizes into a black syrup that stains everything it never touched.\nThis second transmission from RDKPL for ECHØVEIL RECORDS is a factory that learned how to hunger. Conveyor belts drag fragments of cracked cartilage, bent screws, sheets of metal that still think they are sky. Electricity misfires in animal patterns. Viscous clusters of fly matter pulse like auxiliary organs. Fermented sweetness curdles with arsenic dust. Mustard gas blooms softly, like a flower trying to remember war.\nEverything is assembled incorrectly on purpose. Everything fits too well.\nYou are invited to consume it. Not listen. Not hear. Consume. The grill opens like a mouth that has outgrown its skull. Sound drips, congeals, ignites. Your guests laugh until their jaws detach. Lava, thick and neurotic, folds over them in slow affection. Their silhouettes soften, then blister, then reorganize into something edible.\nAfterward: teeth. Only teeth. Hundreds of them. Thousands. Floating, rotating, gently clicking against one another in a charred field that exhales copper, antiseptic, and unfinished biology. They hum. They remember chewing something that was still thinking.\nRecognition protocols initiate. A license plate pulses in the distance. It is seen through grafted infant eyes, still wet, wired directly into hypersensory receptors that cannot close. Vision becomes a wound that keeps opening. Confirmation flickers.\nNo alarm. No crash.\nThe vehicle collapses into itself like a swallowed star. Anti-impact. Anti-sound. A perfect inward violence. The surrounding world follows without resistance, peeled into a spiral that devours its own center. Even the echo refuses to survive.\nplech recøveil everyone!\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Portents of a Dying Swan is the self-titled emanation of a Montréal experimenter who answers, when the fog is right, to the name Grendel’s Mother—that perfidious, rocambolesque chimera skulking between sewer-grates and collapsing observatories. This album is less a “record” than a cracked omen, a delirious sigil pried from the jaws of an anti-world that gnaws its own viscera with shards of the mirror-between-realms.\nAcross its two extended descents, Portents of a Dying Swan drags the listener into dreams of dead ponds and half-rotted wetlands where impossible birds chant in languages of windburn and cosmic larvae. The music seethes with clouds split open like diseased organs, dripping luminescent vermicelli onto landscapes lined with walls of beseeching eyes—eyes begging for a void already overflowing with refuse and revelation. Desecrated candles melt upwards, as if time itself were vomiting; the earth writhes with fetid intelligence; and above it all an impious sky unfurls, populated by a million melting faces whose hollowed flesh glows with colors that should not exist and yet infect your thoughts like parasitic ideograms.\nHere, absurd cockroaches of pure light jitter across the ruins of your synapses, while the scream of an imploding star is fed through broken radio bones until it births new stars—wrong stars—stars brimming with carbonic flesh-things, lopsided Shoggoths, and shards of mocking mirrors that laugh in electric dialects forgotten before they were ever spoken.\nThe album unfolds as a drone-somnambulism curdling into avant-garde nightmare, a fever-dream of field recordings captured from the brink of derangement. It is dark ambient embalmed inside a corpse that still moans through its split womb, nurturing within itself glittering harsh-noise insects that crawl and feed until life and death dissolve into mutually irrelevant abstractions.\nPortents of a Dying Swan is not merely listened to; it is endured, inhabited, haunted by. A hallucinated scripture from a universe where decay is a sacrament, beauty is carnivorous, and music is the slow liquefaction of sanity beneath a sky that never loved you back.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Dans la pénombre d’une ancienne église, J-S Lefantôme a tissé trois dérives sonores où les poussières des vinyles ressuscités deviennent d’obscures prières. Des Litanies d’ogues fantômes échouent sous la voûte d’une nef brisée, tandis que les trompettes étouffées, arrachés à des disques usés, se diluent sous des fréquences froides et lancinantes.\nDes boucles craquelées tournent lentement, comme une triste procession religieuse. Les textures granuleuses s’enroulent autour d’un drone grave, presque immobile, qui pulse tel une chorale enfouie sous des âges de silence. À intervalles irréguliers, des fragments de mélodies oubliées surgissent, s’effritent et tombent du plafond comme une neige de poussière sur l’ancien carrelage.\n-ossements\n---\nVinyl dust crawls along the arches, whispers of prayers ripped from grooves that never existed. Organ litanies twist, snap, fold into themselves—then vanish. Brass murmurs rot in the corners, leaking cold frequencies that taste of ash and old blood.\nLoops fracture. Loops implode. A drone pulses beneath everything, slow as rot, heavy as the silence that eats the nave from the inside. Melodies bleed through walls, shivering like insects caught in candlelight, fragments falling into the stone like teeth. The ceiling exhales; the floor shivers. Time slips sideways, dissolves, returns.\nNotes become shadows. Shadows become instruments. The nave breathes with a thousand forgotten echoes, each one pregnant with absence. You move, but the sound folds around you, dragging your body into corners that were never rooms, corridors that never led anywhere, vaults that remember only the dust of voices long erased.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "“Stone Liturgies” drifts upward like a scorched mantra from the abyssal underworld beneath Girona, where Empty Value hammers meditation into corrosion and turns contemplation into a slow-burning exorcism. Across four entranced tracks, noise becomes a form of prayer: zen-feedback spirals, molten souls dripping through fractured apertures, the anguished cry of sacred stones dreaming of their own dissolution. These are cracked litanies, wandering along the desolate ridgelines of a world long stripped of sanctity — an ebony dream erupting into roaring euphoria somewhere in the night of unmade time. The album writhes like the soundtrack to some minor hell performed by soot-eyed monks of a burning Gyuto Tantric Monastery, their chants uprooted and flung into the grasp of tentacular forces from beyond. A deep and troubling sonic affliction — the kind only Empty Value could ever summon.\nThe album sinks into its own grave with an enigma-track — a kind of buried dungeon-noise, writhing with blind larvae and counterfeit invitations from realms that should never answer back. It feels like a lure carved in rot, a whisper wearing another creature’s mouth.\nAnd then the tomb cracks open again: as Empty Value's vision exhales its final dead breath.... two sprawling re-dreamings emerge—cryptic distortions birthed by the capricious UgUrGkuliktavikt, that eternal saboteur of order. He stains the sacred stone with the viscera of entropy and dreaming lunacy, rewiring the entire work into hauntological mirages: psychedelic spirals, abstract drone-noise-visions, a pair of deranged monuments where the album disintegrates into pure, shimmering madness.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "systeme is the celestial reactivation of relais, the sonic project of German artist T(h)om(as) Fleischhauer, originally active between 1995 and 2005 and now rising again from its upper-atmospheric ashes in the year of grace 2025. This return arrives as a quiet event of great magnitude for devotees of experimental electronic music, nocturnal ambient drones, and narcotic acousmatic drift.\nThree tracks. Three systems. Three exquisite losses of orientation. Each piece unfolds as a tightly defined phantom-world with its own internal logic, yet all remain bound within a larger meta-system whose mechanisms are capricious, whose valves are metaphysical. Sound-walls assemble themselves inside an industrial-surreal structure, self-erected somewhere on Gliese 12 b, while extraterrestrial ghosts flutter through pistons and pressure chambers.\nThere is a voluptuous sensation of falling into a cosmic void composed of pure beauty, with the nightmare never far away, diffused, revealing a half-flesh, half-metal face without eyes. This is anti-music that radiates both warmth and cold, comfort and unease. Ambivalences multiply and propagate. Mathematical equations become crawling chimeras. Antimatter composes upon an impossible staff.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "TEETH is a 28-dimensional breach into the sonic labyrinth of British sound-alchemist Steve Rufus, operating under the alias Russell’s Teapot. A hallucinatory organism rather than an album. Lysergic, unsettling, intoxicating, compulsive. Opioid nightmares rendered in radioactive color, where industrial psychedelia, witch-house residue, prog delirium, avant-noise abrasion and funereal drone-ambient coagulate into a single trembling mass.\nGigantic extraterrestrial fireflies feast on night wanderers beneath a streetlamp made of soft, flaccid flesh-confetti. Tainted surrealism. Haunted dada. A black honey distilled from bad-trip stars, an insectoid overdose of euphoria and dread. You fall into the void, then discover strata beneath the void: diffuse, humming, ether-soaked sound-matter. The skin of the dream is split open, and something syringe-like, batrachian, unspeakably alive is laid inside, writhing under a jaundiced sky of yellow, green, fuchsia and demon-light.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "“The Devil’s Advocates” is one of the latest unholy dispatches from Ontario-based hauntological sonic misfit Phibes Praetorius — one of the great unsung necromancers of occult sound collage, a spectral artisan whose music seems to crawl out of abandoned radio towers and half-collapsed séances. For years, he has haunted the periphery of ECHØVEIL’s fevered dreams, like a distant, rag-wrapped older brother to UgUrGkuliktavikt, breathing static into our lungs long before we were born.\nThis new abomination — ultra-distorted, psychoactive, mutilated, demented beyond the realm of polite frequencies — is as good an initiation point as any. A fissure. A wound. A doorway held open with rusted nails. The first in a series of transmissions we shall exhume.\nImagine a Gothic castle collapsing under impossible Lovecraftian angles, stones screaming as they fall. Imagine a misshapen corpse pounding on your door, grinning with gums full of rot, asking politely to be let in. Imagine the echo of the echo of the echo of a murdered choir, spinning in the void like a broken prayer wheel. Imagine black clouds forming a mouth above you, drinking your soul like a milkshake, slurping with thunderous delight. Imagine the soundtrack to an underground satanic witch-cult film no one admits to having seen — a cursed reel spliced with nightmares, Hammer Horror on PCP, delirium in film-grain.\nIt is grandiose. It is riveting. It is deranged fun dredged from the abyss.\nA nightmare that refuses to stop giving.\nA ridiculous, gorgeous, over-the-top monstrosity.\nA relic of darkness.\nA beacon of madness.\nAnd above all — it is unspeakably, obscenely, deliriously GOOD.\nAnd then —\nthe tape folds,\nthe night exhales,\nthe whole album seems to grin sideways at you,\nas if whispering: this was only the surface… the surface of the surface… the rumor of the surface…\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

Each star moans and implodes in slow motion. Psychedelia and decay intertwine. It is a magnificent ruin, a delirious echo of its own afterlife — beautiful, exquisite, and utterly unclean.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "The weary travellers found solace in the abandoned ruins—\nor thought they did—\nThe castle waits.\nThe castle eats.\nThe walls laugh.\nThey lick.\nSouls of the tormented curl in the corners,\ntheir own thoughts turning sour, feeding the stones.\n—listen—\na whisper scrapes along the battlements,\nsomething dripping down the hallways,\nan echo that tastes like blood and dust.\nThey were eaten.\nNot whole.\nNot quick.\nInside their skulls, worms of unreality writhed.\nThey dreamed through each other,\nthrough the mortar and the floorboards,\nthrough the laughter that never ends.\nThe air is thick with absence.\nA piano plays without hands.\nShadows kneel where no light falls.\nThe castle prays and feeds in the same gesture,\nan unbroken loop,\na meal without table,\na hunger without hunger.\n—who will feed it next?—\nThe walls are patient.\nThe corridors do not forgive.\nThe castle has learned the shape of fear,\nand it reproduces it.\nNo one leaves.\nNo one survives intact.\nAll that remains are whispers,\nincomprehensible, ecstatic, cruel,\nfeeding.\nThe weary travellers once walked these halls.\nNow the halls walk inside them.\nThe castle laughs.\nThe castle eats.\nAnd still the night goes on.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A whisper from the threshold, a dream’s remainder still trembling in the lungs.\nRags Ov Light — also known for the spectral architectures of Ghost Light and Circle Ov Ghosts — here abandons all geography to follow Randolph Carter through the vertigo of sleep and myth.\nWhat begins as dungeon synth, crystalline and somnambulant, soon disintegrates into dark ambient cinema — vast, airless, and unnameable. Minimal electronics drift like thoughts too faint to surface. The music does not unfold so much as leak, like candlelight through the cracks of a forgotten temple.\nEach track is a door. Each door opens inward.\nThe traveller’s soul hums in low frequencies, guided by dreams of impossible suns.\nThere are no choruses here, no endings — only corridors of echo, haunted by Lovecraft’s ghost and Carter’s endless voyage beyond the veil.\nA masterpiece of the Cthulhu mythos, and a privilege to let it breathe — and decay — within the vaults of ECHØVEIL RECORDS.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt\n--------\nTHE STORY:\nWherein our legendary protagonist and Dreamer rivaled only by the Great Kuranes himself passes out beyond the boundaries of Earth's Dreamlands through the vast gulfs of space to explore the even Stranger dreams of alien stars.\n********************************************\nThe Unusual Voyage - Wherein our protagonist and hero Randolph Carter, the greatest of Earths Dreamers save for the Legendary King Kuranes himself, boards a mysterious silver galleon bound for distant alien shores. Through the milky way and beyond.\nThrough Astral Tides Upon Lunar Shores - Wherein the mysterious silver galleon puts into port upon the dark side of the moon, which just so happens to be but a stones throw away from Earth's Dreamlands. Where our protagonist outsmarts some moonbeasts, with the help of some far out cats and procures a most wondrous and sacred Soma, said to be the extraction of Earth's dreams and a most particular ambrosia and delicacy of the Gods, for what are dreams but hoped fors and silent prayers, before setting off again on towards farther ports.\nBeyond The Moon - On past Neptune with Her frozen spires and sentient fungi born aloft by the wind. On past Fabled Yuggoth Herself, the Underworld and Library of the Elder Gods, the home of the fungal record keepers of Time's arcane eddies and warfs, deeper into the deepest realms of Cosmic sleep.where no Dreamer, even King Kuranes himself, is known to have gone before.\nThe Gulf Of Astral Sleep - What unholy vastness of celestial void where formless things gibber and howl, the silver galleon plowed on towards the furthest reaches of Dream and alien dawns.\nStrange Dreams From A Dark Star - Towards what Cosmic Hells the galleon drifted, far beyond all known galaxies uncharted deep within the starless void of deepest space and time. What alien dreams slither forth from that black hole, that final stargate, ancient beyond ancient, primordial Gods of Madness stalk the spaces between giving birth to unimaginable and unlimited nightmare horrors. The silver ship of fools pushed on through the wiell of deepest night...\nWhere Outer Gods Dwell - Through the graveside beyond time, beyond the Ultimate Gate, the Last Void, deep within, beside and beyond the furthest unnamed gulf... The Outer Gods! What sacred and Mystical Horrors these unknowable transcendent Nightmares and Dark Effulgent Deities of Dream... Ever beyond yet whispering Their unearthly songs to madmen on lonely mountaintops beyond the cold Wastes of Dreamland and from the odd non-euclidean angles and shadows of their fevered and unholy visions...\nThe Record From Yuggoth - Wherein we conclude our story and some archeologists find a mysterious wax cylinder of unknown and alien origin deep within an Australian desert believed to be the final testament of Randolph Carter narrating his most unusual exodus through the Outer Dreamlands and Beyond.",

            "about": "I try to capture Saint Francis in one of his ecstatic visions. The sound is brittle, close to breaking, crackling. Through Grace, Francis is allowed to hold the Christ Child.. the Blessed Mother looks upon Francis with Pure Love. Francis is holding the Living God, who allows Himself to be helpless..\nHere we have my attempt to explore unimaginable beauty through textured minimal sound. I wish you Goodness.\n-Saint Elisabeth\n---\nThe Vision of Saint Francis of Assisi marks the beginning of a new ECHØVEIL series devoted to the back catalogue of one of the most singular and essential voices to emerge from experimental noise in recent years: Saint Elisabeth.\nThe Vision was my first passage into the quietly immense world of Saint Elisabeth, and it remains a profound privilege to be able to share this work. Across eighteen minutes, it unfolds as an experience of ethereal, ambient, and minimal noise that invites meditation rather than spectacle. It is a music of gathering and release, of questioning and inward listening, of emptiness edged with moments of fragile euphoria.\nWhat descends upon the listener feels less like sound than a fine rain of silvered metal, falling slowly, insistently, until even the most imploring interior spaces begin to soften and glow.\nThere is nothing else that sounds quite like this. In his search for the divine within noise, Saint Elisabeth touches something rare: a form of transcendence that does not announce itself, but hums softly at the edge of perception. Beautiful without ornament. Severe without cruelty. Essential. Prodigious.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "THUMPER rises like an unnamed organ from the abyss, pulsing with the delirious heartbeat of THE GOLDEN SPIRAL—Porlie Eidolon’s secret conduit. In this project, fragments of the world—field hiss, bowed shadows of corroded instruments, scavenged echoes from obsolete machines—are rearranged into post-modernist rituals, neoclassical specters, ambient phantoms gasping through broken movements.\nReleased on the artist’s birthday, THUMPER unfolds as a birth-wound, a spiral-shaped breach in reality. Here, nightmares glide with a morbid grace, brushing against the listener’s soul like the wings of some patient abyssal creature. Fog becomes memory; memory becomes myth; myth collapses into a labyrinth of sound where impossible monuments rise—sonic clouds ossified into unholy geometry.\nAcross two immense, abstract, cinematic incantations, THUMPER whispers its doctrine of fragmented unreason: shards of occult films that never existed, reels burned by time, murmurs from dying elements and collapsing horizons. It is a pilgrimage into the drowned edges of consciousness, where beauty and decay coil together, inseparable, trembling in the spiral’s cold light.\nFun for the WHOLE family!\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "\"Tombs\" by Needles is a sonic procession for liquefied crypts and worm-eaten memories. Dungeon synth or dungeon noise? It hardly matters — here, everything collapses, fades, and erodes beneath the bite of a wind no longer of this world. A wind that reeks of exhumed soil, spoiled humus, and phosphorescent white grubs writhing through the nerves of a stillborn dream.\nThe keyboards stagger, breathless, like black candles flickering in a bottomless nave. Wails spiral, unplaceable noises crawl along the inner walls, childhood nightmares stretch and mutate into vaporous ogres.\nIn three serpentine sub-movements, Tombs unfurls its sooty litany, woven from false comforts and too-damp truths. Each note is a skeletal finger brushing your spine, each breath a whisper from the void calling out your name.\nTombs is not really music... It’s the ground opening beneath your feet, faintly resonant, ready to swallow your soul for eternity.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A single descent. Twenty-two minutes of collapsing matter, of steel lungs and corroded neurons grinding against the bone of time. Tunneling was recorded two years ago in the stagnant hum of Peoria, Illinois — but it feels older, like the sound of Nikola Tesla in awe, experimenting with his electrical discharge tubes one damp summer night.\nThis is harsh noise as hypnosis — trance born from abrasion. The frequencies shimmer like molten glass; textures breathe and suffocate, everything vibrating between pain and revelation. Woods Mattress digs through layers of decay and electricity until only pulse remains — primitive, physical, infinitely abstract.\nAn astonishing work of sonic erosion: one track, one wound, one endless tunnel through the skull.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Oh, this is the good stuff. The kind that pulls you into that special place where pain and joy collapse into one.\nExperimental DooooOOOOOooooooOOOOOm-drone metal of the highest caliber.\nThe material here is viscous. Doom stretched past genre into substance. Notes do not begin or end; they secrete. Feedback flows like sap from a wounded amplifier: slow, adhesive, almost tender. One does not listen. One is coated.\nVoluptuous languor. Ecstatic suffering. A euphoria that does not rise but sinks, deeper, warmer, more irreversible. Psychedelia without color, or rather: color seen through closed eyelids, pulsing in red-black tides.\nComparative structures (approximate, unstable):\nSunn O))) — amplification as monolith, but here softened, made febrile.\nCathedral — ritual heaviness, re-liquefied.\nEyehategod — filth transmuted into narcotic clarity.\nOm — repetition as prayer, the deity absent.\nKyuss — desert heat, slowed until it congeals.\nBoris — mutation, continuous, cellular.\nEarth — time flattened into a horizon.\nCorrupted — despair architected in low frequencies.\nElectric Wizard — intoxication ritualized, thickened.\nMelvins (Lysol phase) — abrasion as texture.\nSleep (Jerusalem) — pilgrimage extended beyond destination.\nBut this is not synthesis. It is pressure convergence. A storm slowed to near immobility: psychedelic hail suspended mid-fall, each fragment humming.\nThe listener reports:\n• irises flooded, oversaturated, unable to close\n• tympanic membranes strained, then opened, then rewritten\n• bodily heaviness reinterpreted as pleasure\n• time perceived as a thick, liquid column, descending\nFeedback becomes vegetal. It grows. It wraps around the skeletal frame of the compositions, not choking but adorning. Pain is not removed, only rendered exquisite.\nThere is mastery here, but concealed. Nothing hurried. Everything allowed to ferment. The music takes its time the way a wound takes its time: slowly, methodically, beautifully refusing closure.\nUnder this dead sun, decay is not an end state but a method of illumination.\n- Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "This is an era where sound replaces scripture. Drone seeps through stone walls like miasma, raw black metal crackles like signal fires seen through cataracts, and doom ambient hangs in the air with the weight of funeral incense left to rot. The music does not advance. It circles, presses, hypnotizes, as if time itself had been wounded and now leaks slowly into the soil.\nThe landscapes it summons are intra-terrestrial, buried beneath any notion of sky. Forests sweat mist thick enough to erase geometry. Caves function as organs. Villages exist only as afterimages, already abandoned. Soldiers roam without wars, holding their own entrails in numb hands, less to survive than to delay collapse. Trees murmur apocalyptic litanies in a language older than prayer, their roots tangled with bones and rusted tools whose purposes have been forgotten.\nPlague is no longer an event but a climate. Blood darkens everything it touches. Flesh splits not violently but inevitably, as if obeying a long-postponed command. Hooded figures drift through the haze, neither priests nor sorcerers, merely administrators of decay, recording nothing, preserving nothing. Death persists everywhere, not as an ending, but as a background condition: grinning softly, teeth eroded, endlessly patient.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "It does not seek traditional harmony, nor rely on abstract imagination, it presents the existence of sound itself.\nSounds are constantly interrupted and reorganized between silence and eruption.\nEach track of the album reflects the absurdity of reality, order and chaos intertwine, meaning is temporarily stripped away, leaving only direct perception and space.\nThis is not a pursuit of beauty, but an observation of existence and absurdity, attempting to render the fragmentation and disorder of everyday life.\n-Solstice D’hive\n---\nSometimes, from the void, an album latches onto your mind like a lucid fever, a pulse of unearthly light threading through the cavities of your soul. Unquiet Hearing is such a phantom: pure, unhinged, deliriously alive, a labyrinth of sound that refuses to be tamed. Solstice D’hive conjures here a world both exquisite and slightly nightmarish, a reflection of the mind untethered, a mirror to your own hidden unrest.\nFree jazz detonates against spectral chamber-classical edifices; folk whispers melt into your being like liquid memory; ambient-noisy gusts tear through perception, unraveling what you thought was solid. Each fragment, each fleeting motif, is a secret, personal, intimate—an emotive shard of absolute truth.\nThis album could very well become your austere confidant, your bedside oracle, your midnight companion. It nourishes the mind with impossible beauties, saturates the cortex with ecstatic sonic madness, and leaves your senses trembling in the afterglow of audacious creativity.\nIn these dizzying, vertiginous miniatures, Solstice D’hive navigates a cosmos of influences: the violent precision of Naked City, the chambered folk mysticism of Rachel’s, the intricate RIO labyrinths of Henry Cow, pianistic eruptions worthy of McCoy Tyner and Cecil Taylor, the relentless ingenuity of Eric Dolphy, the madcap extravagances of Béla Bartók, the obtuse raw emotion of Martha Argerich, a hyper-tonal Steve Reich reincarnated as surreal jazzman, Alamaailman Vasarat wandering on Pluto, Satie growing mist-fungi in gardens of liquid stars, The Seatbelts dreaming a night in Andromeda…\nEach note is a ripple in the strange architecture of your psyche. Each silence is a wound or a sanctuary. Unquiet Hearing is not merely listened to—it is inhabited, a landscape of delirium, devotion, and unrestrained wonder.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "A ritual performed on rusted speakers.\nUnsharpened Blades beats, limps, convulses — a percussive delirium stitched from tabla remains, found metal, and the breath of extinct radio towers.\nThe rhythm is alive, but diseased — joyous, broken, euphoric in its decay.\nTribal ghosts crash their drums against digital cliffs; tempo multiplies, dissolves, reforms in spasms of molten pattern.\nField recordings spill like mercury — footsteps, whispers, the pulse of cities drowned beneath dream static.\nA phantom organ bleeds through the mist, weaving hymns for circuits and shadows. Voices flicker between tongues, possessed by the mechanical gods of sleep deprivation.\nEvery vibration feels ceremonial, as if the machines are learning to pray again — not for clarity, but for noise, for rupture, for transformation.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Page 1 (missing).\nPage 2 begins mid-sentence:\n…microtonal lattices, improperly tempered, proliferate like numerical mold. Frequencies do not align but insist. Each interval a misprint. Each chord a typesetting error left uncorrected, deliberately or otherwise.\nThe apparatus hums.\nNot music in the civil sense. Rather: a series of measurements conducted by an operator exhibiting advanced signs of cognitive drift. Notes taken in the margins contradict the main text. Footnotes metastasize. Parentheses open and never return.\nDungeon synth reduced to mnemonic debris.\nCompare (inadvisable) with:\nEarthBound — affective naïveté inverted, organs exposed, circuitry dreaming.\nThe Residents — identity dissolved into method.\nPierre Henry — sound as specimen, dissected mid-vibration.\nMortiis — medieval memory decomposed into tonal sediment.\nBut these are only approximations. The present document rejects lineage.\n—\nSection III: On Sleep Deprivation as Compositional Engine\nObservation: extended wakefulness produces micro-deviations in pitch perception.\nCorollary: these deviations, when systematized, generate new harmonic grammars.\nAddendum (handwritten, erratic): grammar is a disease.\nThe pieces within Unspoken unfold as if derived from such a state. Repetition without reassurance. Patterns that almost stabilize, then tilt, then fracture. A melodic line appears, briefly legible, before dissolving into a swarm of adjacent frequencies, each one slightly incorrect, collectively undeniable.\n—\nAppendix A: Phenomenology of Listening\nThe listener reports:\n• a sensation of spatial compression (air thickened to gel)\n• auditory afterimages persisting beyond source material\n• involuntary internal harmonization attempts (unsuccessful)\n• low-grade existential misalignment\nIn certain passages, the sound does not progress but accumulates, like dust inside a closed instrument. Time ceases to function linearly. Instead: stratification. Layers of near-silence pressing against one another.\n—\nErrata:\nThere are no errors.\nOr rather: the errors are the system.\n—\nFinal note (unsigned):\nWhat cannot be spoken does not remain silent. It migrates. It encodes itself in frequency, in deviation, in the infinitesimal distance between two pitches that refuse reconciliation.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt???&%$$*$*%$%(xf¨_)",

            "about": "A soundless omen.\nA wound opened again in the firmament.\nAfter the first leakage of sound, conjured in communion with UgUrGkuliktavikt, engineer of the abyss...\nThe signal returns — weaker, stranger, clothed in strings that shimmer like veins under frost. The black ambient core remains: eroded, unholy, raw beyond recognition. Yet something learned has begun to breathe beneath it — a neoclassical fracture, an alien grace leaking through the static.\nThis is the residue of something thought extinct. A posthumous architecture, built from rotting harmonies and magnetic ash. It does not begin or end — it drifts, implodes, reforms like a mind looping its own decay.\nYou listen, but you are not the listener.\nYou are the medium.\nYou are the altar.\nThe pulse enters through the skull — viscous, endless — and you remember that silence was never empty. It was waiting.\nAnd now, it swallows you again.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "The signal returns yet again, distorted, reborn, crawling sideways through cracked speakers and dead prayers. The sound is no longer a sound but an infection of structure, a cathedral folding into its own echo, an eye that eats its reflection.\nNotes melt.\nTime exhales.\nSomething tries to remember its own disappearance.\nThis second Untitled doesn’t continue — it mutates. It arrives already decomposed, rewriting itself while you listen.\nThe air smells like burning parchment, and still the transmission persists, climbing the walls, whispering through the holes in perception: who sent this? what organ receives it?\nYou think you understand, but then the room bends, syntax collapses, the language forgets its alphabet. Meaning is devoured by resonance.\nAnd in the center of that black pulse —\nnot revelation,\nnot void,\njust the endless trembling of being heard by something that does not exist.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "Vehement Blizzard Destruction is a riddle of ice whispered by Thorns + Compost—a Christian Harsh Noise Wall apparition where nature itself seems to remember forgotten gospels. It is a single twenty-minute whiteout, a hymn unraveling inside a storm that does not want to end, a scripture buried in static that only the cold can read.\nThe lone track unspools like a storm sent to test wandering souls: a catastrophic blizzard tunneling through the senses, conjuring visions of Paysage d’Hiver collapsing into The Rita’s abyssal frequencies.\nBuried within the static, screams flare like desperate prayers caught in the gale—first terrifying, then strangely consoling, as if the mountain itself were grieving in tongues. Over time, something shifts in the listener’s journey: those vocals seem to dissolve into an ambient, spectral rhythm, a trance-current that numbs and awakens simultaneously.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

            "about": "To celebrate the first month of ECHØVEIL’s strange and shimmering existence, the excellent, prolific, Athens-based conjuror Substak offers an exquisite mixtape—an oneiric map of the label’s hidden corridors, etched in frequencies and ghost-dust. Here, the master guides us through a spectral pilgrimage: cinematic Lovecraftian dungeon synth dissolving into dim alcoves; abstract noise walls re-sculpted by phantom hands into hauntological drone; psychedelic avant-rock drifting like a fever dream through catnip-scented vapours; post-industrial hymns half-rotted and drowning beneath dark-ambient liturgies of abandonment; minimalist Lynchian drone-doom exhaled directly from the mist; and space-ambient elegies where stars die in unimaginable slow motion, collapsing into velvet silence.\nThank you, Substak, for this unholy gift of sound.\nAnd by the way—this release is completely (and utterly) free. ENJOY.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt\nTRACKLIST:\n1.Akhalis - Chaton - Part I\n2.Rags Ov Light - Beyond The Moon\n3.Errant Static - Luna\n4.Substak - Cosmic Voids\n5.Circle Ov Ghosts - Pralaya\n6.Substak - Dark Energy Singularity (remixed by UgUrGkuliktavikt)\n7.Empty Value - Stone Liturgies - Where the Stone Dreams the Ruined Heavens Backward (reshaped in the shadow-labyrinth of UgUrGkuliktavikt)\n8.Gogol - Before the Burial",

            "about": "My dear friend Substak is back at it again.\nVeils Falling II – A Middle-Aged Person’s Guide to ECHØVEIL is what happens when the fog never lifts, but you’ve learned how to move through it by touch, memory, and mild intuition, without smashing your knees on the furniture.\nWelcome to the ECHØVEIL mansion, where every room hums with strange foreign sounds, both soothing and deeply suspicious. Substak leads the way through the half-dark, a courteous guide in a place that may or may not exist. You will wander impossible corridors inhabited by ghostly sonic entities, descend into basements populated by gigantic anthropomorphic rats (pure Bruno Mattei energy), and cross paths with oddly mellow psychedelic vampires who mostly just want to talk.\nIf you’re lucky, you may even be allowed to inspect Sir Kuliktavikt’s coffin, slightly ajar, vibrating softly.\nEnjoy this carte de visite: part deux.\nAnd yes, this release is 100% FREE. Download it, get lost, and don’t worry: the house remembers you.\nTRACKLIST:\n1.FERAL CLAW - Diluculum's Farewell\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/idle-hand\n2.WinDGeisT - The Sacrifice of Beauty\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/nosferatu\n3.Spectre Horsemen, Pale With Dust - They Lurk Betwixt Dub and Sky\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/dub-for-the-national-health\n4.Russell's Teapot - In the Dark\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/teeth\n5.Passé Éradiqué - Déclin des Terres Anciennes\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/pass-radiqu\n6.Empty Value - Procession of the Shattered Veil; Where the Stone Dreams the Ruined Heavens Backward (reshaped in the shadow-labyrinth of UgUrGkuliktavikt)\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/stone-liturgies\n7.Errant Static - Void and Cold\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/of-darkness\n8.KommandOOverdose & I,Eternal - Oeil en Septaine\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/kommandooverdose-i-eternal",

Cinematic horror soundscapes ooze in ultra-surreal hues, while maximalist avant-garde plunderphonics gnaw at their own reflections. Somewhere below it all, deconstructed, noisy, vampiric dungeon synth crawls on its elbows, thirsty and smiling.\nFun for all families.\nEven the extinct ones.\nAnd like all the other \"VEILS FALLING\" entries, this one is 100% FREE !\n---\nTRACKLIST:\n1.Solstice D’hive - Prologue\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/unquiet-hearing\n2.Seinnid - A Light at the Edge of Town\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/moments-of-presentiment\n3.ossements - Suite II - Litanie des orgues\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/r-sonances-oubli-es-sous-les-vo-tes-dombres-de-la-vieille-nef\n4.Séraphitüs-Séraphîta - Movement II\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/lacridronesa-a-requiem-drone-mass-vol-i\n5.Saint Elisabeth - Hospice III\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/hospice\n6.THE GOLDEN SPIRAL - THE WITCH AND THE LIGHTHOUSE\nechoveil-records.bandcamp.com/album/thumper\n7.Violet Stargazer - Corrupted Stargazer - Act 1.

            "about": "This project is based on music, which is said to be occult and very ancient. Some would call it intelligent music. Ragas can be considered a form of ritual, both for the listener and the performer, using this vehicle to get as close as possible to their inner self. This vehicle, these vimanas, are a way to traverse time and space, sometimes even amidst intense noise, as well as during very moderate vibrations. I used rock and ambient drone music to get as close as possible to the phenomenon of raga.\n-Vimanah\n---\nThis night will swallow you.\nTired souls flicker through it, wavering like orphaned flames, grieving without memory of what was lost. A primordial drone hums beneath everything, older than language, older than stone. Meditation shaped like nothingness. A descent to the center of everything, where centuries crumble into powder and epochs that never existed leave their fingerprints on the air.\nDead ragas drift toward uncertain elsewhere.\nThe beauty and abrasion of terminal cities breathe through cracked concrete. Columns of shadow-birds plunge from invisible rafters, feeding on the ecstatic ribs of the expiring.\nAn infinite dormitory awaits. Lichen and moss carpeting its corridors. Euphoria fossilized in patience. Bone stacked beside forgotten recollections. Sleep without dreams, yet saturated with them.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",

The exhaust pipe purring like a lover beneath the spine. Hands busy with crushed mirrors in a basement where a single candle wheezes out dead hymns, each note older than memory, each note designed by an architect who was never born and therefore never stopped building.\nSoot speaks. The prophet descends upward downward upward. Knees shiver. Time slows. CRACK. Sound breaks a bone somewhere far away.\nDolls rot in Mexican trees.\nA furnace room under a primary school in Silent Hill keeps its mouth open.\nShadows practice entering me.\nSoul pain. The blues.\nI punch rusted bicycles. The phone rings inside a corroded underground booth. I am afraid to answer. I answer.\nIt is me. On the other end. Mouth full of black soil. Laughing. The laughter crawls out and becomes luminous cockroaches.\nA new state of matter. Recycled plastic. Glassy. Clean. It announces the death of the entire football team. Ebola sunlight. They melted politely.\nI shoulder a backpack stuffed with wrong noises, strangled cries, impossible snakes. I go home. Head down.\nWhy die.\nWhy die.\n-Sir Kuliktavikt",
