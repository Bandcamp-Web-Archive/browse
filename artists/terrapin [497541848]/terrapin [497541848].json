Time, is fickle as the wind, And brittle as the twigs on a bare-branched fruitless tree, Autumn comes again every year and sets me free. From the cares, cos everything ends. Turning on the wheel, Nature doesn’t care how you feel about the loss. It’ll all come back with a little trust.",

                    "lyrics": "An early Autumn evening, And the pavements were flooded with leaves. Kicked up as I skipped down the road, Red and amber and green. Saw the strangest sight of all, The courtyard crushed by the scene; An animal hiding in a tree, Scaring the life out of me. A bird and it was calling down, Out from a high-up branch, “Search your thoughts and find some meaning” But my feelings remained untouched. Seething pain inside my soul, Like I was being torn in half Lost and lonely and all I could think of, Was the image of an orphaned calf. Well, I don’t know. There I was, kinda scrawny at nine, Brushing out the knots in my hair. Fed up, tearing up, I lie down on my back, Close my eyes until I’m not there. Guess a number between one and ten, And forget all the others exist. Paint a picture and study up the fixtures, Whatever it takes to resist, Coming out of autopilot, A perfect fix to make use of the wind. Shuffling cards and holding up a placard, Saying something straight or sarcastic, Well I don’t know. And I’m sort of sad to suppose it’s all just fine. When the levee breaks, well, I’ll be the first to hide. And I’ve been lying awake, wishing I couldn’t cry. Because the time is late and I cannot dream a lie. Better lost than pretending I’m right where I want to be, I guess,  And sharing’s overrated though, so I’ll just let the world turn a blind eye. Truth is so undefinable and the worst always follows the best, So starting a fight and making amends can be the same thing once done twice. And as the evening darkened, I fell on the mattress of my bed, Lying face up, staring out at nothing, just wondering what it’s like to be dead, A thought-filled nightmare, I cannot just get away, even though there’s escapes, Brave what’s coming, oh hell, it is numbing me down, I’ll be fine in the end. Well, I don’t know. And I’m sort of sad to suppose it’s all just fine. When the levee breaks, well, I’ll be the first to hide. And I’ve been lying awake, wishing I couldn’t cry. Because the time is late and I cannot dream a lie.",

Eddie had something ready, In his pocket. Annie braided my hair and cut it. He said that love is caustic. She kept it in a locket. Now i crawl, Through the dark, Forming a picture of the future path. I’ve got time, I can’t grasp. You say its gonna pass me by so fast. I won’t see it ticking by. But I am awake and kicking. High up in your fortress, I couldn't see your wickedness. Your wickedness, Your wickedness, to me. Eddie said it was time, To be someone else. Let your mind fly away and forget this, Body, in all its twistedness. Calming, the spirit in it. Annie had carried her poison with her. And she gave me a sip, To calm the nerves. I, was shaking like a leaf. Her kindness came as a relief. So, I watched, As she danced, To a song inside her head. Then she sang, It to me, It was beautiful and bittersweet. Why? Could I not hold her, Tight, a ghost inside the skin. High up in my fortress, I couldn’t see, Her tenderness, Her tenderness, Her tenderness to me.",

But when the world is turning cold and bare and grey, I just want to lie in my bed all day. Cos in Autumn, it gets darker and soon then, I’m in the clutches of winter depression, And it’s crushing my spirits, And I don’t know if I’ll make it out alive. I’m at war with my own head, I wake up, I wanna go back to bed. Need some noise to drown the dread and fear of what’s next, It’s hard to exist, and that’s hard to accept. Oh, in Autumn, it gets darker and soon then, I’m in the clutches of winter depression, And it’s crushing my spirits, And I don’t know if I’ll make it. In Autumn, it gets darker and soon then, I’m in the clutches of winter depression, And it’s crushing my spirits, And I don’t know if I’ll make it. It gets darker and soon then, I’m in the clutches of winter depression, And it’s crushing my spirits, And I don’t know if I’ll make it.",

There was little for us to do, So, we just watched the branches move, In the gentle August wind. I felt low but you don’t see it. We sat around and looked away, Watched the wildlife and how it plays, Does this ever feel natural? I don’t know how to act natural. Paint the sky in colours of red, I felt a deep kind of sad when you said, “I think I might go home now.” But I felt more alone before somehow. I don’t know why but I, Felt a little ignored. When you said you liked me when I smiled, Just a little more. And it’s not unlike me to hide, So, it’s not all your fault, But you know I’m trying to be honest, And it feels like I’m being punished, For the result. And I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I was bored when you called me along, Sat by your side but didn’t really belong, I walked a mile in the rain for you, I walked a mile in this rain for you, Sat by your side but never really belonged, I walked a mile in the rain for you. I don’t know why but I, Felt a little ashamed. When you said, “You’re all stressed out and isolated these days.” And it’s not unlike me to be shut off, Yeah, I know that statement holds some truth, But lately, I’ve noticed I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I felt more alone with you, Than I did on my own. Well it’s alright, Cos I’ll come back again. It’s alright, Cos I’ll come back again. It’s alright, Cos I’ll come back again. Yeah, I’ll come back again.",

And as I stood, watching the rain, As it fell on all our lakes. Strangled voices cross the void, And seen but no response. Careless fortune, childish boredom, Takes over at once. Imagination, television repeats and reworks, Maceration, crass division, The strange, euphoric hurt. Make me wonder, Meet me somewhere, Maybe in the dirt. I’ll be there when he needs me most, I’ll lay down my pain and come. Find my place in the frightful cold, Strange kind of solace, From the burning of the world. Am I coming last or coming in first? Just at the back of the race. Well, I don’t know.",

When you didn’t answer your phone earlier, Well, I was kinda worried about ya. You’ve been seeming so far away. Lost in a place in your mind. When you stay there too long, You get left behind and I know, Sometimes, I read it wrong, But you know that I care And I want you to feel at home. I wanted you to feel at home. I meet you on the porch in the night, It’s 4AM, you’re smoking a joint. I try to be comforting, but I’m not socially apt at this shit. I’ll tell you a joke, make you sorta laugh, You’ll hand me a smoke, and I’ll cough my heart out. And I’ll sing you a song that I wrote, And I’ll cry in the verse, where I say, “I don’t wanna go”. I don’t wanna go. Now, that it’s over, I’m sad, I wish I could find you in my dreams, But they’re full of fucked up menace and it hurts my head. You tell me I’m better at living right, I say, “I’ve been struggling in a fight with myself, It’s a fucking living hell, and I can’t see clearly.” I can’t see anything at all. Can I talk to you honestly? I’ll just make up a lie, you won’t stay. Guess we can’t hang out properly, these days.",

Tricks and traps are not so easy to find, When blindfolded, dizzy and alone. I found my thoughts made the worst company, So sharks may find me, take me home. Then, I’ll be here waiting, Cold, alone and naked. Cos shadows make fine friends, When the emptiness starts aching. I need a hand to hold, Maybe a knife to cut to the bone, Ain’t so bad at all, after all, after alone, after_ After… Laugh at my jokes, I’ll laugh at yours as well, The television’s heaven but my body’s in hell. Dab my tears away, as if you didn’t cause them. Cos, I’ll be a rabbit, in your snare. I am not scared and I don’t want to go home. I’ll be a rabbit, I’ll be a rabbit. I’ll be yours to own. I’ll be yours to own. I’ll be yours to own. And I’ll be here waiting, Cold, alone and naked. Cos shadows make fine friends, When the emptiness starts aching. I need a hand to hold, Maybe a knife to cut to the bone, Isn’t so bad at all, after all, after alone, after_ After… I’ll be here waiting, Cold, alone and naked.

When winter comes, my body will freeze, My blood will never run wild, again. Not like it did then, And sound is a mysterious friend. Yeah, sound is a mysterious friend. And I’ll be happy once more, Like I used to, long before, The sky turned black, And I found my body on the floor, And I was high above it, Don’t put me back, Don’t put me back, no. Don’t put me back, no. Drenched in tar I’m so changed, I will never be the same. Shattered glass in my veins, Reflecting pieces with fresh names. Dizzy now and swaying side to side, Like a piece of driftwood in the tide. Spinning round, I’m out of time and space. Lonely cloud, raining down my face. And the scars are mine to trace, And my head and heart are out of place. Yeah, my head and my heart are out of place. But I’ll be happy once more, Like I used to, long before, The sky turned black, And I found my body on the floor, And I was high above it, So don’t put me back, Don’t put me back, no. Don’t put me back, Don’t put me back, no. Don’t put me back, Don’t put me back, no. No, don’t put me back, no. No… And the scars are mine to trace, And my head and heart are out of place. And the scars are mine to trace. And my head and my heart are out of place. And my head and my heart are out of place. And my head and my heart are out of place. Yeah, my head and heart are out of place.

Yellow teeth, sticking out, Picking up worms just to throw ‘em around, I’m a kid, I forget, We’re playing chase in the kitchenette. Orange squash stained my shirt, And we got caught in a blizzard. Locking hands, brittle bones, I press my ear to the stereo. Cotton wool, I clutch it tight, I’m feeling the pull of a satellite. Watching space, the moon and stars, What’s it like out in the universe? All my friends are gone, And now it’s only me and my bedroom. It gets dark in the night, I think I see a creature, It’s gonna break into the house and eat ya alive, It’s gonna eat me alive, Drag me back to its den, I’m staring at the ceiling, Trying not to cry, And I’m scared again, I’m scared again. Too late to make amends with myself, This will never end. Complicate what’s already a mess, Concentrate on whatever’s left. Sing out, no-one will hear, What a way to confront your fear. I’m invisible, I’m a freak. I’ll be alright with catastrophe. All my friends are gone, And now it’s only me and my bedroom. It gets dark in the night, I think I see a creature, It’s gonna break into the house and eat ya alive, It’s gonna eat me alive, Drag me back to its den, I’m staring at the ceiling, Just trying not to cry, But I’m dead again, I’m dead, my friend. I’m dead in my sleep. I’m dead in my sleep. I’m dead in my sleep. I’m dead in my sleep. Staring out through the glass, Sink my feet into the grass, It’s a shame, my head’s a cloud’s, Can’t think of anything now. There’s good in this world I know, But sometimes, it feels like I’m buried below. I’m still a kid, I forget, Cos it’s so dark in here, I can’t see anything.",

Take my hand, I’ll try to_ To become it again. “Yeah, it’s alright”, No, I’m afraid. But I ain’t got anywhere else to be but here, The fear crawling up on my knee... I shiver in the moonlight, And at the motorway stop-by, You take me in and make me part of you. I’m losing my bearings, I’m fading in and out, When you hold me like that. Please don’t hold me like that. You turn me into, You turn me into, You turn me into a sewer rat. You turn me into, You turn me into… And I hate it, Yeah, I hate it. But why then, do I always come back? Hot food, Fries at my lips. Burning at the tipping point, And I’m nauseous in the back of your car. You squeeze my hand, And my throat is filled with your tar. Kill me like a pet, And put me down with a poison, It’s what you do best, But I’ll whimper back to the comfort. Your hand on my chest, And my head on your shoulder, I wish that this could end, But I’m scared without you it’s colder, I’m scared without you, It’ll only be colder. So, I shiver in the moonlight, And at the motorway stop-by, You’d take me in and make me part of you. I’m losing my bearings, Yeah, I’m fading in and out, When you hold me like that. Please don’t you hold me like that. You turn me into, You turn me into, You turn me into a sewer rat. You turn me into, You turn me into... And I hate it, Yeah, I hate it. But why then, do I always come back? See your hand on my chest, My head on your shoulder, I wish that this could end, But I’m scared without you, It’s only colder. Your hand on my chest, My head upon your shoulder, I wish that this could end, But I’m scared without you, It’s only colder.

And I know, I know, I know, I don't let it show, but I'm bleeding from the brain, And the crows, the crows, the vicious crows, they torture me and twist my mind insane. I'm a zombie boy, I've numbed my body, so I don't care about the storms. I'm a lost cause, smiling on the surface, but drowning underneath. Does it fool you? This happy kid you see? Cos this joy is shallow and hollow, a broken vase of promises of shelter, I'm already dead and my whole head's corroded. I'm just a zombie, Just a messed up ghost you walk right through. Smoke was rising, A funeral pyre. For all my trying to shut out, That murderous liar. But the dark, the dark, the lonely dark, It wraps around your hands And leaves you blind. And it breaks you, takes all the ways you can fight back, And steers you from behind. Now I'm a zombie boy, I've numbed my body, so I don't care about the storms. I'm a lost cause, smiling on the surface, drowning underneath. Does it fool you? This happy kid you see? Cos this joy is shallow and hollow, a broken vase of promises of shelter, I'm already dead and my whole head's corroded. I'm just a zombie, Just a messed up ghost you walk right through.

Saw red kites flying above these fields, Photo reels in my eyes, Imprint tomorrow's disguise. What a cold sight, Little bluebottle flies, Clambering the windowsill, Cobwebs between you and I. Small harsh breaths I exhale from my lungs, Heaven is death's sweetest treat when you're young. I'm turning over the soil again. Holding cover to cover of the bed, Making a den out of pillows we found, There is dread and despair in my lonely sick head. I'm a dream, I'm a nightmare, I'm neither I'm aware. There is something out there looking for me, While I'm washing down the daily machines. And I'm alone, And the child has grown, I'm turning over the soil again. And daylight will fade, it never stayed, It died in the Spring back then, And miles will pass, As I turn over the soil again.",

And I felt like I was home again, Is it a season, a feeling too scarcely spent? Moving house, And making changes, Carrying heavy loads. Discovered floorboards, Blue-bottle flooded ceilings. Make a pot of tea on the stove, In a saucepan, Bring it to the boil, It can mean a moment, Strangers folding in from the corners. And I’ll be there, When I’m needed most. I’ll lay down my pain and come. Find you there, With pieces broke, Take my hand and squeeze it numb. And there is something in this hole, That kinda reminds us of the good. Sometimes, people, they do harm, It hurts, but we heal, we come together, In the hull of it all.",

But we’ll make it through, For you’re the truest green, Red and blue, I’ve ever seen. And you’re coming out in me. In the summer, we ran through the fields of gold. Honestly, honestly, I felt whole. Tried to give you a hug, did you love me enough? Honestly, honestly, I don’t know. And as Britain will do, the summer turned cold, Honestly, by this point, I’m used to it. Cos, I get what I want then I lose it all. Honestly, life is kinda hit and miss. I get upset, over some things you said, As you hiss and growl at me. I walk away, you sulk and lay down on the concrete. I’ll bring you this and that, You bring a rat and I chased you both away. I’ll beg of you come back, I knew deep down, That the both of us are strays.",

Do you realise I hide my shame? In the dust and asphalt, Your limbs were dancing wild. I was awakened to my senses, Like a curious child. Was this a prison or a castle? That I walked in naïve, Colourful pretences, Kept my fears up my sleeve. Now, I wear my fear on my sleeve. Maybe I could say I’m sorry, But I’m scared I will amend alone, And even if my heart could take it, I can’t build a bridge on my own. Is there anything to reach for? Or are we nought but ashes? You were in league with a thinking machine, I unexpectedly shed my skin. All the things I kept within, The strange relief of breaking, The piercing song it sings. Were you happy to love me? If only in your way. Now, you can hardly look at me, Was it growth or decay? Would you build a kingdom? Just to throw me out, You were scared of me changing, But where are we now? Where are we now? Maybe I could say I’m sorry, But I’m scared I will amend alone, And even if my heart could take it, I can’t build a bridge on my own. Is there anything to reach for? Or are we nought but ashes?

A separate state of existence, With all the sharper pieces missing? So we could hold it tight, And not bleed right through. But when I found the knife, It was deep in me and you. Now, I no longer stay, In the rosy shade of a setting sun, We’re packing up, We’re moving on. Our love is ancient, Can I perch on your mountainside? You’ll keep me guessing, all the while. Can we reverse time? When the wind howls wild, Through the echoey arches, The air turns cold and bitter, With the winter marching in. I hold your hand, Tight as gravity holds in the moon, There’s a certain distance, Between us, but a bond beyond ordinary truth. So, when I can’t tell you, Just how much I love you, anymore. You’ll have to look up at the sky at night, And trust I won’t let you fall. Out of this orbit, Out into the vast abyss of darkness, That demons inhabit, I won’t let it be your habitat, no. Our love is ancient, Can I perch on your mountainside? You’ll keep me guessing, all the while. Can we reverse time? Can we reverse...",

If I could follow the fish again, Would they find me ill or would we all be friends? If all of the oil would rinse away, Would we build cities or revert to a state of decay? I don’t know. But now, all that is breathing is rationed air. And the clouds are sick with the stench of despair. Could I be something in this vast abyss? Of space between the orbit of rocks and the kiss? Of stars whose light spins and dances? Was it all a dream or just a song we sing? I don’t know. Caught again, in this fisherman’s net, I struggled furiously for a bit, But I rested in my defeat and regret. Now, I’m strung like a bullet in a gun, And they tell me lies, Squeeze lemon juice right in my eyes. It’s a fickle man’s bet. If I was to channel my rage and fight? Would I taste their blood or would they feast on mine? Their violence is written into my bones, Do I chisel it out or twist it into something of my own? I don’t know. But now, heaven’s colliding with hellish realms. And how, is hope rational with soldiers at its helm? Could I be something in this vast abyss? Of space between the orbit of rocks and the kiss? Of stars whose light spins and dances? Was it all a dream or just a song we sing? Could I be something in this vast abyss? Of space between the orbit of rocks and the kiss? Of stars whose light spins and dances? Was it all a dream or just a song we sing? I don’t know. I don't know... Oh to drown to the ocean floor, And see the creatures there, How they live and love. Soon, I found I could breathe under the water, I swam along, and that was enough. That was enough. That was enough.",

If I was to live for a thousand years, Maybe I’d eventually adapt to the fear, That lurks so deep underneath. But I wouldn’t be who I am now, Not that I’m the same as I was even yesterday, Midnight blue to indigo hues. And when the weather came, Melancholic rain, Better than the savage heat of the sun, What has come, what has gone. Night arrives as day is done. They never met. If I could assemble the universe, Into a pattern made of colours and words, Could I really see into eternity? And when the planets died, Would I still feel sad inside at all the death? Or would I be stoic? Oh, I wouldn’t be human anymore. Would I even have a soul? I wouldn’t be who I am now, Not that I’m the same as I was even yesterday, Midnight blue to indigo hues.

Down in my heart, Where there should be answer, There’s just a beat that’s starting to slow down. I don’t belong, I feel wrong existing now. Many miles away, there’s a river calling my name. many miles away, there’s gotta be someone feeling the same. But it all feels so big, and I feel so small and unprepared. Losing again to the mind games I play in my head. Since I was small, I’ve had a thought, That all is balanced on a knife edge. And in its spiral, I’ve been caught, Numb in a limbo of paralysis. Can’t quite accept the darkness that inhabits my mind, Keep it defended from light that could make it vulnerable. I can’t pretend, that everything is fine, Anymore. Many miles away, there’s a river calling my name. many miles away, there’s gotta be someone feeling the same. But it all feels so big, and I feel so small and unprepared. Losing again to the mind games I play in my head. If I could fly like the birds above, If I could fly, I’d fly away. If I could fly like the birds above, If I could fly, I’d fly away. I'd fly away.",

In the dark of the woods, I heard you calling, I tried to run but now I’m falling. If I try real hard, I can still hear your voice, But now I hear another, Telling me to destroy it. I’ll destroy it. Lighter in my hand, And the weight, it subsides. Flicker in the dark and I wanna, Burn it all, burn it all, Burn it all down. Do you remember the state? That I found you in. Blood was rushing from your side, And I couldn’t stop it. Tried to bandage it up, With the blindfold that was still in your pocket. It wasn’t long enough, And you told me to run, I’m already done for. I'm already done for. Stole the knife and ran, Faster than I’ve ever ran before. Muttered to the head of clan, I’ve got some plans of my own, To settle a score. I’m the demon. I’m the devil now. Living and breathing, In my soul. And they tell me to sleep, And to forget any promise I said I’d keep, To those left behind in the woods. In the woods. In the woods. In the woods. In the woods.",

Pouring down once again They find me sitting at the edge of my bed Pondering everything But if you visit me when I’m old Grey hairs on my head I might not know your name  But I'll remember the touch of your hand Holding mine squeeze it tight  Keep me smiling keep me fighting Even when its a cold horizon As I watch you lie, you’re barely there, The room is bright, but the mood is like the air, Stale and slightly strange, it’s a cold horizon. And we fix our eyes, upon the screen, It’s easier to watch along than try to bleed, A little talk out of your mind, it’s a cold horizon. And when we leave, you start to stir, Do you recognise me or is it just a yearning for some attention? Your vision is blurred, anyway. It’s a cold horizon. It's a cold horizon. Pouring down, once again. We find you sitting at the edge of your bed. Do you remember anything? But if you visit me when I’m old Grey hairs on my head I might not know your name  But I'll remember the touch of your hand Holding mine squeeze it tight  Keep me smiling keep me fighting Even when its a cold horizon If you visit me when I’m old Grey hairs on my head I might not know your name  But I'll remember the touch of your hand Holding mine squeeze it tight  Keep me smiling keep me fighting Even when its a cold horizon It's a cold horizon And later when, I’m lying here, I’m barely there, confronted by my fears, That all is heading towards a cold horizon. And it’s easiest to just watch along, When I feel something, bleed it out in songs, They ask me where they’re coming from, From the cold horizon.",

What’s worth knowing til you’ve grown old? Waiting for a day when I can brace any storm in my coat. Got to talking with myself about the devil and god. I’ve been fighting a war in my mind. I’m still trying to put the demons behind.\t Got to let go. I know I’ve got to let go. Waiting for a day when I can be myself without fear, What’s the point in education if it just leads the kids here? To a station with no trains or destinations, To a road without markings, I was lost in contemplation. Waiting for a day when I can find myself excused from the pain, Bless the morning, bless the hellfires and rain, I’m still trying to work out the depths of the sea. Won’t you trust this raft and swim out with me? Just gotta let go, Of all that I hold, Embers and coals in the palms of my hands, Got to let go, Of all that I hold, Embers and coals in the palms of my hands. Got to let go, Of all that I hold, Embers and coals in the palms of my hands. Got to let go, I know I’ve got to let go. Waiting for a day when the wind grows quiet again.",

Warm, your hugs are so warm, I could stay in your embrace forever. And though, the weather is grey, You are my raincoat, and I’m your umbrella. Don’t say that you want to go home, I do too, but I’d rather be here with you than alone. I’ll make sure that you’re safe, always, It’s my ultimate aim, I’ll shield you from pain. The last train departs, at midnight. But I can’t be there on the platform, to say goodbye. Cos I won’t let you leave. I won't let you leave, no. When you’ve gone, I cry, til my sight’s a blur, And nothing looks real. Then, I dry my eyes on the sleeve of my jumper, And I bury what I feel. Cos to feel, is to hurt in a world that taught us evil, And love is a curse, I can’t shake or keep unrevealed. The last train departs, at midnight. I can’t be there on the platform, to say goodbye.

Before, the corner was a safety pin, Now I’m buried within a box. I can’t see, Blood among the roses. Can’t really feel, Can’t really think, Strange little song that he composes. We sailed the night like shelter, From watching eyes. The wind was wild in winter, Summer came like a flash of light. Can’t you see? The damage lives unharmed. Can’t you feel? The savage sea is calm. In the remains of a shipwreck, I will swim, Or I will sink. In the remains of a shipwreck, I must swim, Or I will surely sink. I can’t see. Can’t really think. I can’t feel. I might sink.",

Into this daunting cave, I must go. Until the dawn comes, Promise me you won’t dare to follow. In the distance it glows, Sunrise ahead. I got caught up in all the wrong things. Never imagined it would go like this. I guess the snake of time bites her own tail, Sometimes, to venture forward’s to fail. War to no avail, Breaking to heal. Sunlight’s sweet kiss. Into this daunting cave, I must go. Until the dawn comes, Promise me you won’t dare to follow. In the distance it grows, Sunrise ahead. I’ll be right through, To your house soon. Forgive, somehow, My soul, Immanuel, I’m bruised, My heart is weak and fused, Bring me the water, To wash my wounds. \"Vanished\" Dream a little about, A time, a place, A hill and a house. A lake, birds by the dozen, You bake, sweet apple pie, So good I could die, And maybe I will in a moment. Memories lost, I can’t put in place, Vanished without a trace. Hide, desperate and wild. Night is close, Hear the wind, how it howls and blows. Try to sever the child, From the dwell of a ghost, Blood in the snow, Snow falls on snow. Ashes will grow. Fractures I can’t, Fix without cost, Lives I’ve lived and lost. Maybe I’m ready, To let it all go. Maybe, we’ll never know. Memories lost, I can’t put in place, Vanished without a trace. Vanished…",

When you’re on the verge of crying, And you’re trying to hide it. I tell you that it’s alright, To let it out from inside, It’s not something you have to hide, From me. Don’t you know it, Don’t you know? Maybe I don’t show it, enough, But I love you. I love you. You rest your head against my arm, I can tell you’re tired. Funny how, ten hours ago, you were running wild. I hesitate to hold you close, don’t want to feel the pain when you have to go. It’s so hard to love a ghost. You fell asleep by the river, I carried you back to your bed. I held back a tear as I watched you lying there, warm under a blanket. I don’t want to see you scared again, Even if you don’t remember the fear yourself, I do, I knew every scar on your skin. I won’t let you see it. Cos if you knew, you wouldn’t smile, And I couldn’t bear it. When you’re on the verge of crying, And you’re trying to hide it. I tell you that it’s alright, To let it out from inside, It’s not something you have to hide, From me. Don’t you know it, Don’t you know? Maybe I don’t show it, enough, But I love you. I love you. Don’t you fade from my mind. Don’t you say goodnight. Don’t you fade from my mind. Don’t you say goodnight. If you wanna cry, If you wanna cry… If you wanna cry, go for it. Don’t you know it, Don’t you know? Maybe I don’t show it, enough, But I love you. I love you.",

I still get the urge to text you and say, “it’s my fault, I messed up,” You got me down bad, down, oh. Well, I sat and prayed, In the rosy shade of a setting sun. For a future love, for a future of some kind. How is hope rational in this landscape? Midnight blue, indigo hues in my mind. I don’t belong, I feel wrong complaining all the time. I should be content, and just accept, be satisfied. I tried to run, ended up falling. If I get drunk, stop me from calling, It’s not a good idea and it’s not a good time. At the edge of my bed, I replay what I said and cringe at every line. Embers and coals in the corners of my mind. I cry til my sight’s a blur. But still the damage lives unharmed. Bring me the water to wash my wounds. Snow falls on snow. Warm under a blanket, That I hold, close to my heart, But it’s still broken. But it’s healing slowly. Slowly.

With you, I hide myself to protect you,  From this thing I’ve become, And as I’m standing in our garden,  I do everything but ask you to come closer, I want to hold you like an emerald in the sky. Would that be alright? Well, I, I have died,  A hundred, a thousand, a million times. But you, you bring me alive. Like ethereal flowers in my eyes. On the winter’s road, I was watching the water. And when it unfroze, well it flooded and surrounded me. And I could feel my boots filling up, And I started to run to wherever I could. But wherever I went, I just felt lonelier. And as it grew, this violent emptiness inside of me, Yeah, I fought back and ran through the derelict forestry, Until I found a bulb, glowing bright in the darkness, That envelopes me like a shroud. And I’m shadowed in clouds. But I, I have died, A hundred, a thousand, a million times. But you, you bring me alive. Like ethereal flowers in my eyes. Like ethereal flowers in my eyes, Like ethereal flowers in my mind, Like ethereal flowers in my eyes, Like ethereal flowers in my life. Well, I, I have died, A hundred, a thousand, a million times. But you, you bring me alive. You’re like ethereal flowers in my eyes. Yeah, I, I have died, A hundred, a thousand, a million times. But you, you bring me alive. Like ethereal flowers in my eyes.

Terrified to speak out against what you’ve seen, Is it all gone or is it living on in your memory? Throwing salt into the sea,  Breaking rocks down from a boulder. When we awake, we will all be, Just a little bit older, than we were, When we were asleep, time is folding in again. And I can see, that what can start, Eventually ends, inevitably. Steady on your feet as you go over the river, The water rushes faster than you know, If you aren’t careful, it’ll take you under. Yeah, I know it’s about control, And how we’re whispers amid the thunder. Brother, I hope you listen to it, Just a little bit closer. Taking the teeth to your skin, Blood trickles out, poison seeps in. Afraid to believe what you’re feeling, The horror and shame that is terrorising you, It’s true and you can’t deny the catacombs of your mind, You keep behind, little artefacts of a child, Who would run and hide in their own tomb. But it will be alright, my Avery. We’re hurling salt into the sea. My Avery, it’s like throwing salt into the sea. My Avery, you’re throwing salt into the sea. My Avery, it’s like throwing salt into the sea. My Avery, you’re throwing salt into the sea. My Avery, my Avery…",

Oh, and I always just was. Oh, can’t remember, can’t recall. Oh, Alex, oh, Alex, oh, Alex. Oh, Alex. You’re my only true friend. Let’s run down a river, let the current take us over. And one day, this mystery will end. And we’ll rocket up out of hell and up into space. Oh, I always just was. Oh, can’t remember, can’t recall.",

I’ll be crying into your shirt, I’ll be lying on my bedroom floor, Wondering what the hell it was all for. Why do I love you when you’ll never love me back? How do I forget you when you’re all I think about? What was I thinking? What was I thinking? I’ve messed it all up and it’s too late to take it back. I’ve messed it all up and it’s too late.

Marshes, sand, salt and sulky weather. Take me by the hand, and you pulled me closer. Open up your eyes to the fiery ocean. Laying at your feet, I was such a waste. Dumbfounded, out of place, And untying the shoelace of the situation. I could never be, all you need, all you need. You just take what you want and leave, Just leave me. Just leave me. Show me your fire, let in burn in me. I’ll be alright when it consumes me. We’ll pitch up a tent on a windswept beach. Bathe in the ocean’s water, a friend to the weak. We’ll build a tower, out of muddy branches We found underneath and in the marshes. Hold me in the dirt and bring me solace. Forget all the others, don’t let them control us. And set me free. I’ll set you free. Could I ever be all you need? All you need? Don’t just take what you want and leave. What are we fighting for? What are we fighting for? Let me be yours. Let me be yours. Let me be yours. Let me be yours. You’ll always be mine. You’ll always be mine. You’ll always be mine. Salt on the soles of your Johnston and Murphy’s. You stole me away from your auntie’s wedding party. Bored to death we ran down to the coast of somewhere blue. Marshes, sand, salt and sulky weather.",

The river was winding free,  And I was counting up the damage. The trail up here made a killing,  But the view was something to breathe in. Jagged edge of Helvellyn, The claws of the wind were reaching. A butterfly at the summit,  My eyes glancing down. I was trying to find the fun in it, When something bit my ear, And made me turn around. It’s like a breath of air, yeah, around and within. I know you’re close, you’re like a ghost in my skin. You’re like a ghost. You’re like a ghost. Perched on a mountain so rugged, It’s clutching at my throat. The elders stood at the pulpit, As they excavated the hoax. They said: “Boy, you can’t trust yourself!” “You’ll only cause your own grief!” And as I buried all of the questions in my head, I swear I could’ve felt a tremble beneath my feet. The morning air was bitter, And the snow was melting away. And I held your hand a little more timidly, Than I had just yesterday. You said: “Some things are hard to accept, but denial is the friend of the devil.” “So, watch yourself in these sinking fields, kid.” And I said nothing, nothing at all. Yeah, I said nothing, nothing at all. I just stood and stared, a calf amid the cavalry. And I felt my hairs stand up on my neck, As I silently screamed. And I shook my head, wiped my tears on the sheet. I refused to let the demons become me, And took apart the pages of the books I had read. And I levelled the shaky ground, Helvellyn living within. The coarse Earth to which my body was bound, Feeling like a ghost in my skin. I’m feeling like a ghost in my skin. I’m like a ghost, I’m like a ghost,  I’m like a ghost…",

I’m crying alone, well crying’s not quite what it is, More like staring at a wall and feeling small and inadequate, To be alive, to live a life, I’m a fraud and I’m a hoax. And the worst part is I know that you’ll always care, And you’ll always try to be there for me. Why do you waste your time on me? Why do you waste your time on me? AM, again, the only time that I’m safe to be a mess, I’d burn the house down with me in it, Just to see if I’d sleep through it with an eye open. And the stupidest thing is that, I’ll always fail and blame someone else for it. Why do I try to run from me? Why do I try to run from me? And the worst part is I know that you’ll always care, And you’ll always try to be there for me. Why do you waste your time on me? Why do you waste your time on me? Why do I try to run from me? Why do I try to run from me? Why do I try to run from me? Why do I try to run? Why do I try? Why do I…? Why do I – why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?",

And I hoped I was okay but I swayed, As I swept away a tear that ran from the hurt. Frightened little kid, Feeling scared and confused, here. Oh, March is long gone, but it hangs in the air. And the fear’s still there, the fear’s still… I remember now, lightning water from the river. Oh, hell, it came pouring down. I’m frozen still, can’t move from here. But I woke to the sound of singing birds. And I hoped I was okay but I swayed, As I swept away a tear that ran from the hurt. Frightened little kid, Frozen still and confused, here. Oh, March is long gone, but it hangs in the air. Oh, March is long gone, but it hangs in the air. And the fear’s still there, the fear’s still… And I woke to the sound of singing birds. And I hoped I was okay but I swayed, As I swept away a tear that ran from the hurt. A frightened little kid, Feeling strange and confused, here. Oh, March is long gone, but it hangs in the air. And the fear’s still there, the fear’s still… “Strange” Everyone spoke at once and no-one was able to listen, The words came together in a mess of confusion. Oh, my hands are tied up and my mind is made up, I’m giving in and I’m giving up. If you can’t make something better,  You’ll have to come to peace how it is, Or just throw it all away. I feel like my brain is fucked up and I cannot change the situation That I’m in, that I’ll always be in. And I remember one time feeling strange, Standing over me, shouting, full of rage. Spitting in my tearful eyes, Scolding me as I began to cry, oh no, Oh no I’m a fucking disgrace. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. Sometimes, the hardest decisions are the ones you put making at all, Is my free will a waste? Oh, my hands were tied up and my mind was made up, I’m giving in and I’m giving up. Oh, I feel like my brain is fucked up and I cannot change the situation That I’m in, that I always seem to be in. And I remember one time feeling strange, Standing over me, shouting, full of rage. Spitting in my tearful eyes, Scolding me as I begin to cry, oh no, Oh no I’m a fucking disgrace. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. Oh, my hands are tied up and my mind is made up, I’m giving in and I’m giving up. Oh, I feel like my brain is fucked up and I cannot change the situation That I’m in, that I’m always in. And I remember one time feeling strange, Standing over me, he was shouting, full of rage. Spitting in my tearful eyes, Scolding me as I began to cry, oh no, Oh no I’m a fucking disgrace. Spitting in my tearful eyes, Scolding me as I began to cry, oh no, Oh no, am I a disgrace? Oh no I’m a fucking disgrace. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange. La, la, la, la, I’m so strange.

The stories written in the brackets, And the soldiers waiting in the barracks, All stare down at me. Cos they can’t see what I see. There’s a child at the table next to me. They’re chewing their teeth on the scenery. Their mother’s cradling a baby, And their father’s staring down at a screen. And they look over at me, Cos, they know I see the way that they see. Little raven with the red hair, Brittle face streaked with aged tears. Yeah, I’ve seen this all before. And I regret to recall the endless nights that I’d cry away, Don’t forget and don’t fade away, Little raven, you’re just starting to learn to be brave. Cos he ain’t ever gonna listen to you, kid. And she is always gonna think that she’s trapped here. And you’ll grow up to see yourself as the dogshit. Cos he will earn your trust and make you his project, And she will shun you into the arms of a cold witch, And she will fuck you up and blame you for it. And the moment you fail him, his faith in you will vanish, And the second you doubt him, he’ll be shouting down your throat. And she’ll ignore you more the older and taller you grow. And he ain’t ever gonna listen to you, kid. And she is always gonna think that she’s trapped here. And you’ll grow up to live in a cold abyss, I know these surroundings, It’s bound to happen around here. Cos it’s bound to happen around here. Can we get out of here, little raven? Cos I’ve grown bitter and I’m slowly hating myself and this world, Just a little bit more than I ever, ever intended to.",

Leave now? You should’ve left yesterday. Break down, cry on the phone, Say how everything feels wrong. I owe you everything.  You know what to do. I should be more grateful. But I am just a selfish kid, I never think twice about the damage That I cause, I’m words on a wall, And I can never find the courage. I forgive you for everything you didn’t mean to do. I should be more grateful. I owe you everything, you knew what to do. And I should be more grateful. What do you care? Do you care at all? Maybe I’ll never admit to myself how small I felt,  Under your stare,  I remember looking through you to the wall. I know you were lost in yourself, but that ain’t no excuse. Fuck the past, the future’s new, I’ll let it bloom, I’ll let it bloom. I’ll let it bloom, I’ll let it bloom, I’ll let it bloom…",

From the morning mist in the valley of the Chiltern hills, I’m silent and still, my skin prickled from the winds of November. Does carelessness with bones make for heretics of hope? Evidence for ghosts is thinning out. Everything, I know, fades eventually. It’s better to restore than throw away what’s old. Out the second window, I glance down below at the snow, It was pure like a child’s soul, now scarred by the scares of yesterday’s month. From the cold stone steps of the churchyard walkway, My thoughts delay, like a string played around in the clouds above. Does carelessness with bones make for heretics of hope? Evidence for ghosts is thinning out. Everything, you know, will fade eventually. It’s better to restore than throw away what’s old. It’s fair to say Antarctic rainfall is rarer than snow in April, But I don’t find it unreasonable to accept simple miracles. Like eyes that melt within your own, And the kind of smile that makes a home, I’m all inside, I can’t let it go, Just warm up my bones and I’ll bloom with you. And I’ll bloom with you.",

And as your hair sways like grass in the breeze, We’re holding and we are held. Immortalised daffodils on the moor. Our nightmares may find us once again and haunt, And long nights suffocate the breath. Your mind’s child walks a fine line between rebirth and death. And I see your silhouette when I’m half-awake. Weather fickle and branches so brittle they break. Through the dancing spring and the restful summer’s escape, From this wanting and taking, that festers and invades me when I’m afraid. When I’m ashamed. Collapse into chaos, fraying at the edge. Collect up the rations and count up the damage. For savage nights and hostile days make for bitter creatures. But fawns will suffer at the claws of vultures, Like predators and prey. And I’ll feel the ghost of your hand against my face. Blessed friend I didn’t love enough, you taught me how to be brave. Into oblivion, I will descend til I find my place, In this loss and remaining,  New ground and retracing through memories I’ve kept, Reserved in my caves. The sun will rise, and the sun will set, Simple knowledge we so easily forget. Cos high and low tides will enshrine the ghosts of your past selves, From when you were a child to the last days whose presence you haven’t yet felt. And the world will turn, and my stomach will churn with the weight, Of feeling the hurt and joy of living in the most absurd state. From the raging mind to the brave young fly, I’ve made my mistakes, But I’ve learned to hold them with a little more tenderness, Still, it can never erase the blood that has stained. But then I’ll hear your voice as an echo in my soul. Let it immerse me in the universe and make me whole. In this everything, we are held, and we hold. We are born thriving, screaming and crying, Kicking with life, the immense and the small. The immense and the small.",

She’s a wonder indivisible, I am half that, Threads on a fraying end. Half-light and always invisible, But she sees me, And holds my hand. Sweetest flower brimming, With delight, I’m singing to you. Daisies in my heart, Days we’ve spent apart, Can’t be counted on fingers, Anymore. But I still dream, I still do, of course. Sweetest flower brimming, With delight, I’m singing for you. Daisies in my heart, Days we’ve spent apart, Can’t be counted on fingers, Anymore. But I still dream, I still do, of course. I still dream, I still do, of course. Sweetest flower, Every waking hour. Daisies in my heart, Days we’ve spent apart, Can’t be counted, Anymore. But I still dream, I still do, of course. I still dream, I still do, of course. I still dream, I still do, of course.",

And now that I’m older, I’m still just a kid in its maze. And I felt through the walls, The path to a peaceful place. Inside of my mind, And I hid out there for days. See, when I was three, I wasn’t free at all. From the belt of the car seat, To the driver who kept me small. The road had no atlas to follow, My feet didn’t even touch the floor. In this perpetual static, I felt the absence of control. And when I was twelve, I felt the tension rise. A gun to my neck beckoned action, I couldn’t take, For the sake of my friend’s eyes. Pleading me, Seeing me as his brother of a kind. So, I denied, But the gun still fired, Just with a different result in mind. Now, he’s gone. His blood on the white tile. Now, I’m lost, Buried it for a long while. How to go on? How am I alive? Sing a song, more than one, To remember him by. Be free and choose for yourself? All an illusion. Be free and move yourself? Life in stop motion. Be free and choose for yourself? All an illusion. Be free and move yourself? Life… Life in stop motion, Life, life in stop motion, Life in stop motion.",

Don’t you know the past is a passing place? Well, the truth is complicated  Like a box, I'd rather keep closed The bruises hesitate to go And while we laugh unchanged It still burns a little low I wish sometimes i could change the channel  and watch an entirely different show Cos it’s easy not to remember But it’s harder to forget And these feelings that you harbour  Don’t make a peaceful place to live You can try to drown them out But they'll be drowning you Cos it’s hard to repress the truth When the lies you kept have broken And it’s time to change the bandages When its bleeding through The wounds have opened up You can’t tape it up and move on Anymore Well, the truth is complicated  Like a box, I'd rather keep closed The bruises hesitate to go And while we laugh unchanged It still burns a little low I wish sometimes i could change the channel  and watch an entirely different show Cos it’s easy not to remember But it’s harder to forget And these feelings that you harbour  Don’t make a peaceful place to live You might try to drown them out But they'll be drowning you Cos it’s hard to repress the truth When the lies you kept have broken And it’s time to change the bandages When its bleeding through The wounds have opened up You can’t tape it up and move on Anymore",

I make you a picture, And envision your delight, Such a pleasant surprise, But you chuck it in the bin, Well I guess I'll just set all my drawings on fire. Does it matter if it all burns? Play it up to another of my turns. Do you see me, while you're sat on your throne? Do you feel it, when i cry all alone? Does your heart flood with aching compassion? Or do you mute my voice and not think of me at all? I’m patiently waiting, Entertaining myself in my brain, It gets easier each day, Cos I get so much practice, While you waste my spirits away, Desperate and clinging, You sigh with dismissal, I learn abandon like a secret code, You use to convey your disinterest, And closeness is a dream, I keep locked and closed. In the night, I rock myself, Back and forth, til the fright leaves, I ain’t asking for your help. Cos you don’t see me, from the height of your throne. And you don’t feel it, when I cry all alone. And your heart’s cold and vacant of compassion. You just mute my voice and don’t think of me at all. Is the colour gone? Has the world gone grey? All awash with despair and a strange dismay, For the things in your life that don’t involve me, I’m just a second thought, always a distance away. And I try my best to honour your wish, While I tremble alone from my toes to my wrists, And the darkness grows like a silent abyss, But I won’t know how to cope, wasn’t made for this. And the photographs present happiness, But the videos reveal emptiness, Like a wrapped up box with nothing in it, I wanna go home but I’m already here. And I try to impress you, gain your attention, Bend over backwards for your affection, Dance in your light, soak up your shadows. I’d give anything for some temporary bliss, I’m only a child but I think I deserve this, So yearning subsides and isolation grows. Do you see me, while you're sat on your throne? Do you feel it, when i cry all alone? Does your heart flood with aching compassion? Or do you mute my voice and not think of me? Do you see me, while you're sat on your throne? Do you feel it, when i cry all alone? Does your heart flood with aching compassion? Or do you mute my voice and not think of me at all? Do you see me, while you're sat on your throne? Do you feel it, when i cry all alone? Does your heart flood or ache with compassion? Do you mute my voice and not think of me at all?",

We were only children, But we were charged with a sentence, Meant for evil men. The kind that kept us imprisoned, Locks in our minds, And guards posted at both ends. Is this the end? Is this how it ends? I will kiss your scars softly, If you’ll let me. I still miss your warm heart, Does it miss mine too? I will see you again, only in heaven. I’ll be counting up, from minus seven. Minus seven. I remember running, My heart was thudding loud inside my chest. Was your heart too? I remember humming, A tune to calm you down. You recorded it and put it on a loop. I remember feeling, Like a chick destined for slaughter, Waiting helplessly inside a coop. I remember running, running, Blood-stained shirt, and bruised-up legs, Tired as hell, but somehow still going. Somehow we’re still going. I still remember you, After everything. Your love is snowing down on me. From the open sky. Do you remember me? Like a faded photograph, With a teardrop in my eye. I remember you and I, Millenium babies, born into a burning lie. They bled us dry, oh but we stayed alive. They tried and tried, to turn the day to night. I remember you and I, Millenium babies, born into a burning lie. I will kiss your scars softly, Will you let me? Cos I still miss your warm heart, Does it miss mine too? I will see you again, only in heaven. I’ll be counting up, from minus seven. If we could start again, Seven years earlier, in 1993. Would that give us enough time? To formulate a strategy, To save the younger you and me. If we could start again, Seven years earlier, in 1993.

I hear them on the radio, I see them on the tv screen, They’re talking about the state of the economy. I don’t understand a thing they say, And why should I, I’m just a child, It’s 2008. Oh, how time flies, I’m older now, But I’m still just a kid. Oh, how life dies, Blossoms beautiful before giving in. Now I know where I’m at, And where I’m going. My parents are talking downstairs, I’m awake, and they don’t know it, It’s 2009. Something about the riots, Something about the school, It’s 2010. Every month I’m sneaking out, Turning fear into doubt, I’m only twelve. And this is hell, Knocking at my door. Just like it did, Back in 2004. I hear them talking outside, But I can’t make out the words they say, It’s 2002. Something about the weather, Something about the move, We’re driving off, I’m only two.",

I’m always looking around for you, On these murky moors. We rush down to the coastline, Look, how death is close by. Share a cigarette in daylight. And maybe, life is lonely, And maybe, death seemed tempting, But maybe, there is something more. We tasted it, once before, It was sweet and salty on our tongues. Rough and real and raw and coarse, Moved through us like poison when we were young. I’ve been looking over all these shores, In our youth what was never won, Was the eternity of the pure, As soon as it bloomed, it was gone, Forever, But didn’t we try to make happy? With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. I found you in the old barn, You were steps away from paradise, Or hell, I don’t know. You scold me when I try the same, The rope to starve the brain, Hypocrisy, it’s a name you keep close. Well, time is like a dragon, Feeding off our sadness, To dream up our dreams, Ancient Leviathan. And maybe, I am a dreamer, But you were stuck here believing That only your nightmares could come to life. But the silence gets hard to bear, When every time I call out your name, Some days it’s like you’re not even there, Even when I’m leaning on your bedframe. What if in the night, I was to shake your shoulder, What would I do if you didn’t wake? Wouldn’t I be running down to the creature, I’m speechless without the space, To fathom, Oh, just what kind of torture, Can have them all, And blow out all our torches. Forever, We were just trying to feel happy, With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. Did I ever make you smile in Whale Valley? Did I ever make you smile? We tasted it, once before, It was sweet and salty on our tongues. Rough and real and raw and coarse, Moved through us like poison when we were young. I’ve been looking over all these shores, In our youth what was never won, Was the eternity of the pure, As soon as it bloomed, it was gone, Forever, But didn’t we try to make happy? With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. Did I ever make you smile in Whale Valley? Did I ever make you smile? Well, time is like a dragon, Feeding off our sadness, To dream up our dreams, Ancient Leviathan. And maybe, I was a dreamer, But you were stuck there believing That only your nightmares could come to life. But maybe I could make you smile. Maybe I could make you smile. Maybe I could make you smile. Maybe, yeah I made you smile.",

To love, is to be alive. All is gold in the greenness of now. Warmth beholds the sweetest sound. Death conspiring in my mind so blue, How to dissipate the feeling  I've become accustomed to, so well.

And I am just a child stepping out into the world,  Blinking my eyes, once or twice.  First exposure to light has the tendency to overwhelm. It’s not by coincidence that every baby begins with a cry. And I was just the same, growing up quickly, Filling my pockets with love and shame, In distorted measures over time. As summer skies parted in cowardice of winter’s blade. Timid young eyes watched on helplessly as crops were slayed. For the harvest is plentiful but merciless in its ways. An ancient expression of the futility of our days. Sunny coloured hues on the old oak, Honey was the sap that stuck to my fingers and thumb. Hurry, soon the food will be getting cold, Journey on through to where you’ve come from And where you’re going to. It’s all the same, only different in name, you know. Georgie was shy but he loved me, pure and bright. I kept him under my tattered wing when the wind howled at night. For the dogs come a-biting when the flesh is warm and young. Ready the gun and steady your arm to survive. Life was tough but it weren’t anything other than what we knew. And in the rough, verdant blades of grass stick together like glue. For the mud is hard and thick and the lack of oxygen makes you sick, But the surreal sense of something real and true will push you on through. And now I dream of you. In pictures of golden sun and blood red hues. Why does the rain fall on rolling hills like ours? Georgie holding in his small left hand indigo wildflowers.",

The heavy stuff ain’t fair game when I’m in still pyjamas, no. Everybody is looking so smart, Dresses and suits and shiny shoes. We’re buzzing with an anxious hyper kind of happy, Weird a few days ago, I was so blue. Tiptoeing the glass, barefoot in the grass, Take our shoes off and let’s all have a dance. A memory’s what we make it, Brother, I love you and I’ll say it, A million times tonight. I’m rushing around amid the chaos. Got a hundred things on my mind. Like will the words evade me at the worst moment? I’m just keeping my calm, one thing at a time. Tiptoeing the glass, barefoot in the grass, Take our shoes off and let’s all have a dance. A memory’s what we make it, Brother, I love you and I’ll say it. Tiptoeing the glass, barefoot in the grass, Take our shoes off and let’s all have a dance. A memory’s what we make it, Brother, I love you and I’ll say it… Why am I always so away in my mind? Just tonight I’ll leave it all behind, As irrational as it is, My head keeps spinning round again, Wondering quietly: What if this is the last time? (that we’re all together) What if this is the last time? (that we’re all together) What if this is the last time? (that we’re all together) What if this is the last? Never knew it would go so fast. Tiptoeing the glass, barefoot in the grass, Take our shoes off and let’s all have a dance. A memory’s what we make it, Brother, I love you and I’ll say it. Tiptoeing the glass, barefoot in the grass, Take our shoes off and let’s all have a dance. A memory’s what we make it, Brother, I love you and I’ll say it, A million times, tonight.

                    "lyrics": "I retrace my steps from 18 years past An imprint of a footprint That my younger form had cast upon the sand, A moment in time that could never last For the tides wash away and take our plans And it all dissolves so fast, an echo of a life lived and gone But it still reverberates through my body Now I return to the place it came from And it’s funny how so much has changed And yet so many things remain exactly the same And even those that have changed, are not gone, just replaced And the shores I once graced as a sweet young boy  Chasing the ephemeral Are now home to a sweet young boy  Chasing the waves And I recognise these rock formations  Like structures inside my brain And I remember climbing up there Only stopping once we'd reached the highest place I can still hear her warning me To be careful - as if this was where i was really unsafe I never felt freer than when i had triumphed that rock face And it’s still exactly the same,  I remember each slope and ledge, And it was easier then,  I was carefree, or careless. But my troubles, they weren't small They were so intense they were buried like cursed treasure Locked away inside my chest for good measure To protect myself from memories, But now I remember,  And these places are bittersweet, Bittersweet to me. And it’s funny how so much has changed And yet so many things remain exactly the same And even those that have changed, are not gone, just replaced And the shores I once graced as a sweet young boy  Chasing the ephemeral Are now home to a sweet young boy  Chasing the waves Chasing the ephemeral Chasing the day away. Climbing up off the beach, and the rocks scratch my feet. I wonder, were they always this sharp? Or was the younger me smart enough  To have worn something underneath  And the route we used to take is now closed off with red signs  So I hesitate before readily striding up to the right I hike the hill to its top, and look down from above The meadows are all gone, their vibrant grass reduced  To a rough stretch of dirt and mud And i see that some things have changed,  And yet other things remain And i still recognise this place,  Even now, with the land turned over. I can pinpoint where we camped, And where I rode my bike barefoot And just north of that spot used to be a football pitch  Where me and my brothers would play for hours  With kids we'd never met And to the east there used to be a park A little playground, its structures I can barely recall But I remember making a friend and i thought we lived quite close. I was too young to know where we lived. I was too young to have known anything… Now my eyes wander up  To the northernmost point of the meadow Where my skin shivers and trembles  Like the shrivelling of a plant  Growing under a heavy shadow It was night when i awoke  And i left in my pyjamas When i returned The sky was a little lighter,  And my world a little darkened. But I kept it all under wraps,  All that happens, all that i feel And in the morning that place retransforms  Into a corner in a field… And it’s funny how so much has changed And yet so many things remain exactly the same And even those that have changed, are not gone, but replaced And the shores I once graced as a sweet young boy  Chasing the ephemeral Are now home to a sweet young boy  Chasing the waves Chasing the ephemeral Chasing the day away.",

So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.” -\tRobert Frost “Together this time?” “Yeah, together this time.” 1, 2, 1 2 3 4 And she’s coming on the night, But a tear rolls down her eye. For the love she tries to hide, And the stolen people cry: “Our love has been betrayed.” Don’t you smile like that, It takes love back, You think it’s your love that’s been thrown away. But if you can’t find me, Just remember that we’ll see, And go another way. Til tidal waves, And the waves crash on the shore. And I’ll sail to you tonight, To make our love so fine. Til tidal waves.",

Children standing at their father’s grave  Bearing questions from their childhood days Jane and Tiffany were shadowed in shame, oh Stan had his hands round his brothers throat Samuel had spoken in a bitter tone “Don’t tarnish the name of the dead” “Don’t you know they’ll come to haunt ya” -\tStanley Jr, 10 Janie knelt on the soil and laid Indigo flowers on their father’s grave Some are too far gone to ever be saved Samuel recovered with a cough and cry Little streams running from his youthful eyes In need of some comfort he turns to his sister Jane “And I never knew you well…” “You drank far too much and cos of that you always smelled” -\tSamuel, 10  Samuel withdrew and folded the cue card in two Stan bunches his hands in fists,  Refusing to let the anger burst through  Wiping the tears out of her eyes Tif knew of more than one reason why Two weeks ago her father had to die Down in the darkness under the stairs She met up with her sister and they planned from there  A way to corner their father with a knife The blood dripped from the blade Samuel walked in and screamed until his voice was strained Now he can’t remember anything or who was to blame But the violence lives on in his brother’s name Children standing at their father’s grave Sharing stories from their childhood days The youngest was hidden in a hazy shade Stan had decided he would run away Took his father’s bottle as he went his way Jane and Tif held a secret so dark They swore they'd take it to the grave",

I met you in the spring With a bundle of flowers I said I heard you sing Left me smiling for hours We were so young And love came easy A sweet six months And you told me you were having my baby And you asked Will you love me forever? And will you love her forever? Our daughter grew up So quick like the blinking of an eye When her sister was born I was late to the hospital wasn’t I? But I found us a house On maple avenue Said I’d fix it up nice A home for all of you And you asked Can we live here forever? Can we live here forever? When our sons arrived I was working double night shifts We were almost in the clear When the roof finally caved in I did all that I could, and I raised a little money  I was so relieved until it all changed suddenly You sat down by my side and said “honey…” “I won’t be here forever” -\tJoan Arbury In a matter of months The sickness ate into you Your children were crying Little Jane cuddled up to you The boys were so small They fell asleep on your bed As you drew your last breath I wept I will stay here forever I will stay here forever I will stay here forever I will stay here Forever",

I feel numb again, Don’t really feel anything, Been this way, I guess, Since I was a little kid. Last thing I remember is, Cuddling up to mama_ I watch the tv news roll, It’s so depressing but I don’t care, It just goes on and on, War after war after famine. I’ve been studying, For the bar exam, If I pass, may my success last, Longer than I have. And I’m so tired, but I don’t sleep. I’m an expert liar, the secrets I keep, Would send me to the police. I feel a chill again, When Stan drunk dials me at 4am. I listen to the voicemails that he sends, Drunken ramblings beyond deciphering. I push it down again, I feel good now I don’t feel anything, Life is easy on autopilot, But the plane is nosediving. I swear that I’m trying. And when Tiffany calls, Says she’s on the train to mine, I break her fall, at the terminal, Dragging out my protective side. And just like that, I’m Janie again, And our secrets and plans, hit back like a wind, On the coastline of our childhood beach, I hold your hand as you cuddle up to me. I want to be your big sister, But I’m dead inside, ain’t much help to ya, And I don’t really have the energy, But you make me your mother, With the “Janie”",

Isn’t it time you went back home? Ill ride the train with you  I know you get scared when you’re on your own I guess some things never change Every time you come to town  I feel so strange But i don’t want none of your drama Can you promise me this Can’t lie i missed your sweet laughter  But beneath it there’s no difference  You’re still running wild Making your trouble my business Driving me crazy I’m so tired Of cleaning up your messes But you get me every time  With the \"Janie\" Four drinks in and the secret within  Starts to break free, you're shaking  Like a leaf in the winter breeze,  You say you’ve been experiencing memories Of his screams and the blood that he bled I tell you to keep quiet Talk of something else instead How can i? You mutter with a sigh His life and his death are ingrained in me I shouldn't have asked for you anything  Let alone a killing We put him down like a dog And you know i don’t believe But it wouldn't hurt my guilt to receive A little forgiveness from god And I know i should get back to my kids And i don’t know how he has the patience to give I’m scared i don’t deserve this life at all Can i stay here a little bit, can we share the fall? But i don’t want none of your drama Can you promise me this Can’t lie i missed your sweet laughter  But beneath it there’s no difference  You’re still running wild Making your trouble my business Driving me crazy I’m so tired Of cleaning up your messes But you get me every time  With \"Janie\"",

Set in 2005. Mothers, mothers, Moths in our clothes. Eating away at the fabric of our home. Desperate, dark, scared and alone, We grew up in a motherless shadow. Mother, mother, Where did you go? James and Samantha cry in the cold, Their father stands in the doorway alone, Watching as they grow. Are we all the same? Just echoes and reverberations in a chamber. Leaves falling off trees,  The garden grows the thorns of old, The poisoned soil beneath. Mothers, mothers, Dance in the wind. Tiffany runs, From her children to sin. Everyday life feels suffocating, To the child she hides within. Scared and lonely, And motherless too, She tries to remember her, But not a clue, Just a feeling, an image or two, Before she succumbed to the illness. Tell me how it is, Is it so bad? Everything you missed, I wish you had stayed alive to see, The damage done, its happened, The mess uncovered in your absence. Mother, mother, Come home. Mother, mother, Please. Mama, mama, Want you home. Ma, ma, To me. Heaven ain’t for you, Return to me, I need you to, Please see, I’m lost and so confused, Desperate, turning in the dark. Four years old, take me to the park. Push me on the swings. Make me feel like I belong, I need these little things again, Mama, come on home. Ma, come on home.",

I’ll be in the corner always, Venture out, there’s danger, I think I’ll stay. Here where the vultures can’t see me, But I come from their destiny. I hold the key in my hands, Which door it unlocks I don’t know yet, I’ll try every single one til I find it, And discover what’s behind my head. “Sammy, what’s the problem? Hurry up” -\tStanley Sr “I think he’s slow, dad,” -\tStan Jr Stan just laughs “Gotta man up, if you wanna be something” -\tStanley Sr God I still hear him in my head ringing I’m not the son that you want, And he is, a violent shut-off runt, You call me weak and sensitive, But maybe I should see it as a compliment. Something in me shuts down, over the years. Giving in to the shame and the fear, That you fester in me like a shadow, When someone asks me what is wrong, I don’t know. I’ve got the world in my hands, But my arms are crippled underneath your plans, I need to break free but it’s too late, All your lies ingrained me and I’m only eight. I remember when you took us both to see, Your favourite, the star wars trilogy. I cried when the twist turned a knife in me, I could see the parallels, I could see the parallels, I could see the parallels so clearly.",

And I leave a note on the table. Unreadable with a smudge of ink. And I stay in the bar til it’s closing, Did I give you enough time to think? And the darkness is unravelling, Got a monster that I need to feed. You say I’m irresponsible and lazy, I promise, I’m keeping it on a tight lead. And you shout at me on the 21st, Say good grief, you forgot again. Our anniversary, shit, I knew it was coming up, You say I’m not ready for a girlfriend. So I disappear into the night, Go out drinking, smoking and snorting lines. Getting rowdy, I get into a fight, Come home with blood on my hands, Which are gripped around a knife. I’m sinking fast, got no anchor, got no future, Life’s got my head in a deadlock and I’m choking blood, I can’t move forward but I know I should, I slide sideways, I’m a runaway train, argh… And I see you again the following year. When I see my face, yours is painted in fear. And a little shock at what I’ve become. Drunk and dirty and inescapably numb. And you cross the street as quick as you can. And I shout over the traffic jam. Try to rush between the stalling cars. But I trip and fall and break the glass. I’m sinking fast, got no anchor, got no future, Life’s got my head in a deadlock and I’m choking blood, I can’t move forward but I know I should, I slide sideways, I’m a runaway train... I’ve got to change, when I look in the mirror, I cry, eyes wide, fuck my life, I’m my father, And the violence is written in my scars, Metaphysical contagion, caught in a strange addiction. I feel the heat of the water as I step into The shower, feel its cleansing power And I shiver, withdrawal got me breaking out in sweats, But I’m gonna get better,  Yeah I'm gonna get better, yeah I’m gonna get_ Drunk, again. I slide sideways, I’m a runaway train. I slide sideways, I’m a runaway train.",

Set in 1986. Joan said her favourite time of year was the spring, Cos the flowers would bloom and the lambs would sing, But it’s not the same without her beside me. Joan said the spring was her favourite of year, But now my time is spent on despair and fear, Trying to keep it down, and keep myself together. But I am drowning deep, And this family I can’t keep together, Hanging on by a thread. And I think they’ll be better off without me, There was something in my head, As I went to buy another bottle, To wash down the medicine. Joan said her favourite time of year was the spring, But I went out walking through the farmer’s fields and felt nothing, The aching in my head just grows a little heavier. Joan said she loved me but I never knew why, Guess I maybe should’ve asked her before she said goodbye, Walked into that night, I wish I could follow her. Cos I am drowning deep, And this family I can’t keep together, We’re hanging on by a thread. And the lights change from red to green, I stall the car and hear a hundred beeps, Behind me, but I’m somewhere else. I’m with my love, On the last days of spring, Bringing her back, With alcohol-induced hallucinations. I’m with my love, On the last day of spring, I’m with my love, I’m with my love.",

Set in 1986. He wakes to discover, His children are all gone, It’s midday, they’re at school, When they get back, he’ll drunk. It’s been like this for years now, But Tif has had enough, She hates his constant gaze, Now she’s twelve and a half. Jane tells her little brothers To go straight to their room, Samuel sulks and Stan bunches his hand, Punches the wall. Tif lights up a cigarette, Smoking in the bathroom, There’s no lock, 4 o’clock and it’s bad news. I don’t care (lies I tell myself) I’m barely there (will someone help?) I’ve been caught in your whirlwind, And I’m always hurting, But I can’t speak up, Cos that ain’t an option, And it’s not worth the cost if you even hear it. Sam hides in her covers, And Jane makes room for him. She’s used to being mother, To two of three children. Stan leaves in the night-time, He’s looking for trouble, He throws a brick through his neighbour’s window. The cops detain him (son where’s your father?) Nobody saves him (he’s passed out, ain’t he?) I’ve been caught in your whirlwind, And I’m scared I deserve it, Am I a broken child? Will they pull the curtain? Of nothing, I’m certain, Except that I will die, Caught in your whirlwind, Father, we’re hurting, You’re too drunk to realise. We’re caught in your whirlwind, The pain is unfurling, We’re caught in your_ We’re caught in your_ We're caught in your... Whirlwind... I don’t care (lies I tell myself) I’m barely there (will someone help?) I don’t mind (Janie, something’s wrong) I hand you the knife…",

If I go under, help me up. If we’re to suffer, let there be blood. I meet you at the house, on maple avenue. It looks rougher, in the modern view. It’s been twenty years, since we were last here. I remember the panic, the crying, the shouting, the unrelenting fear. I remember me and Tiffany, sitting in the station. She held my hand under the desk as we sat silent through the investigation. I remember taking the plastic yellow gloves out from under the sink. When they find the knife, I said, it’s gotta not have our fingerprints. I remember you crying, saying “I just want this to be over” I’ve got your back, I’m your sister, I’ll see you through to the clear. This can only end in a death, Make sure it’s not ours. We watched as he drew his last breath, Now I’m buying his flowers. Twenty years and the guilt still remains, Like an etching in your brain. I hold your hand, ain’t letting it go, But your tears still fall like November’s rain. Stan gets out of his car, Parked a little askew. His breathing is strong and harsh, He’s had a couple more than a few. I tell him go back home, He says he’s home right now. He’s staring back at the door, Behind it’s where it all went down. Samuel arrives, he doesn’t say a word. All of my siblings in a line, I say that this might hurt. They’re gonna demolish this place, Erase its history. Return dust to dust, I guess, But it roots will live on in you and me. It’s all over, The ashes of the past. The physical reminders behind us, Were never going to last. But the scars still show, Deep and dark and red. And when we go inside for the last time, I can still see the blood he bled. If you go under, don’t give up. I know we all suffered but we never should’ve. We meet outside the house on maple avenue. I think it’ll look better when it’s dust and rubble, don’t you?",

Set in 2005 and then in 2025, nearly forty years after their father’s death, as we learn of where the four Arbury siblings are now. Last I heard, Samuel was working at a bar Three feet off the ground  Living month to month Last I heard Stan was living in Detroit Got no answer last I called Can’t lie i don’t care much for that boy If he wants to throw his life away He can go ahead  I don’t care I’m not saying that if he died I’d be glad He’s my brother I do love him  But he reminds me of... Last I saw him Samuel told me he felt scared  As a child and that his memory Was vague and blurred and hardly there I know that he was only ten when dad died When he died? When you and I Cornered him in the kitchen with the carving knife Don’t remind me don’t put that image back in my brain  I don’t want to think about him Or the carpet blood stained I know that it wasn’t my fault for what he did How he made me feel small Made my body twist round his I just want him gone And his memory too Guess the knife wasn’t enough It just passed along the bruise To you, do you hate me now too? Last i heard  Jane was working 9 to 5 Became a lawyer working murder cases The irony is rife  Last i heard Tiffany gave up on her kids Her husband asked her for a divorce And she tore the house to bits Last i heard Stan overdosed in an alleyway Got rushed to the hospital just too late Samuel wrote a cue card to recite at his grave Last i heard Samuel saved up a little cash Bought a car and drove away Never looked back Never looked back Thank god for that That he never looked back, Never look back.",

Children crying at their mother’s grave, Sharing stories from their childhood days, Jane and Tiffany were holding the frame. Stan had his hand in his brother’s hold, Twins in the sunset of a late spring glow, Darkness overhead as the shadows grow. Stanley knelt on the soil and laid, April flowers on his late wife’s grave, Four kids behind, and what future remains? Samuel quivered in the frosty air, Summer was near, but the sun wasn’t there, Time is a dragon feeding on despair. “I never knew quite why,” “You loved me, but some reason, you did” “Why did you have to die?” Stanley withdraws, from the graveside, And down deep into his thoughts, “I will never survive” “I will never survive” Children crying at their mother’s grave, Eight and six and four years of age, Too young to know how the paths are paved. Time runs wild and the seasons change, But even as they pass, some things still remain, Ways of being and blood in your veins, Passed down your way.",

I’m working at the panto, Just barely scraping by. I moved out of the suburbs, Just to live out my own life. Just to live out my own life. And if you ever want to see me, You can call, And I’ll be there. I will be there. Well, love it was fantastic, When we kissed in the dark of the arcade. Shared a packet of tangfastics, Sugar rush before pride parade. I’m sorry I seem absent. I’ve got a lot of heavy thoughts on the brain. No, I don’t know what happened, But I swear to God I’m doing OK. And if you ever want to see me, You can call, And I’ll be there. I will be there. I’ll be there, I will be there. Well, I did not expect this. I hated dressing up as a kid. I was always kinda nervous, Hated attention, it made me panic. And sometimes, in my memories, I think maybe it was not so bad. And maybe I’m just spoiled, ungrateful, But I won’t be_ I won’t be ashamed of who I am. I won’t be ashamed of who I am! Well, you showed up to the panto, Bought two tickets for you and your friend. And you came to see me, Backstage, post-make-up, right at the end. Do you have any regrets? Is there anything you’d like to forget? Is there anything? Like “I love you”, That you wish you had said? Well, I don’t know, And I don’t know and I don’t know. Yeah, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. But I will graciously accept it’s time to go, Cos I’ve the role of a hero. I’ve got the role of hero.",

Oh, beckoning the dark. I turned four in mid-to-late July, My soul was bought by a demon of lies, Every sin earns me a place here in hell, Threaten me dying down the empty well. I’m beckoning the dark. Oh, beckoning the dark. Maybe you’re a lion, And I am just a rabbit. You caught me in your snare, I was scared and shaking. You took me to your lair, Then you left me here swaying. I’m beckoning the dark… Maybe you’re a lion, And I am just a rabbit. You caught me in your snare, I was scared and I was shaking. Took me to your lair, And then you left me here swaying. I’m beckoning the dark… I was born on the fourth of July.",

Is there any kind of justice? Left inside of my head? Well, the orphanage rang, And they found me a place, I turned up at midnight, And I looked a disgrace. The carpet with thick, With the dust of the dead. And I buried deep the conscience Inside of my head. And I buried deep the conscience, Deep down, deep down inside of my head. And you said: Everyone, everyone, Everyone goes in the end, so… Everyone, everyone, everyone. Well, the sadness was pure, But it was built from the hurt, The demon’s old spell, With which he dealt a curse. Silence rang out, From the hall of West Warf. And the terrors they stirred, Pulled us back from the wolf again. You pulled us back from the wolf again. And you said: Everyone, everyone, Everyone goes in the end, so… Everyone, everyone,  Everyone goes in the end. Well, I guess that was the last time, I saw your eyes, Before the heavens woke up, And hell rained down on paradise. Well, I guess that was the last time, I saw your eyes, Before the heavens woke up, And hell rained down on paradise. Hell rained down on paradise. But I’ll always remember your fierceness and your pride, The gallantry you showed even to the day you died. The softness of your beauty, the fragility of breath. We’ll all be laughing with you in the cold arms of death. This is a song for the dead. This is a song, a song for the dead. Everyone, everyone, Everyone goes in the end, so… But I’ll always remember your fierceness and your pride, The gallantry you showed even to the day you died. The softness of your beauty, the fragility of breath. We’ll all be laughing with you in the cold arms of death. Everyone, everyone, Everyone goes in the end…",

I know, I’m to blame for these things I didn’t prevent. Poison in my water, To numb the conscious mind, He’s strangling his daughter, And I am hindered blind. Take me to the death well, And dangle me by my feet. Morning comes with a demonic spell, When the sun lights up all the trees. When the sun lights up all the trees. Cos we, we are never going to breathe, Fresh air again, Ghosts live in our skins now,  Davey, my dear.",

And my grana, she loved me, More than anyone else, In the world, made me the happiest chile. And in an alternate timeline, We never even moved, I grew up in the Bailey, Where those fantastic trees grew. I was never a chess piece In a game played by demons, I was free with my spirits renewed. I was confident and friendly, I knew everyone by name, I was present in the moment, I was present in the moment, Instead of a ghost, pale zombie kid,  Ghost, pale zombie kid, lost in a haze. Sometimes, I wish shit could change. But fucking hell, what’s a plan we can take? Where shit doesn’t end up just the same? The same fucking mess, this shit was always this way.

I will never lose sight of you, again. I will never lose sight of you, again. I will never lose sight of you, again. Cos you’re the one that made me find a way through, Time and time again.

Murder at Billion Terrace I was wearing out my shoes, I was wearing down my shirt. Didn’t know which way to choose, But either way, my feet still hurt. I’ll keep walking ‘til we find, Some fresh water to drink. Cos, I don’t mind the reminder, Of the place I watched My babies sink. And I don’t care for the rules, And I don’t care for you. And I do what I want, And what I want is to get rid of you. I won’t say it twice, I won’t say it twice. Cos, I walked to Billion Terrace, In the night to find you there. And I saw another morning, Coming out of the fresh air. What could’ve been_ What could’ve been there? I don’t know. I don’t know. And it spoke to me with confidence, And it spoke to me with fate. And I understood the conference-tations, It comes often off the edge. “But I don’t mind anymore,” That’s what I said. (vocal riff break) I don’t care what you think, I don’t care what you know. Cos, I will go where I want, And I will see the people I want to see. Cos, I’ve taught a million minds, How to think, You didn’t think I knew how to think? No! And I will stand at your gates, And say it’s all my fault. Cos, I don’t want to hurt you, I just want to see you fall. Just to see you ashamed, Embarrassed and awkward, Frame you cannot unhold. This is you now, every night, You’re taking out the trash. And you have seen things you won’t forget, Yeah, they stained your eyes. Cos, life is strange in some ways, But horrifying in others. Cos, they will murder your friends, And they will turn you against your brothers. (vocal riff break)",

I want to be silent like the sea when it’s quiet, I don’t want to be like the sea when it’s violent. No, that’s not me. That’s not me, that’s not me. That’s not me, that’s not me. That’s not me, that’s not me. I’ll be back in the morning, When I’ve worked it all out, When the words are simple, And erase the doubt. I will turn in the headlight, See the way that it rolls. And I take you, arm by arm, And we’ll stroll out into the midnight storm. Cos, we’ll be like ghosts. Every time I close my eyes, I see the things I say I don’t remember. And I wish that I could restart somehow. I wish I could restart somehow. But it’s late December, And you’re cold. I’ve been thinking forever, This story’s gonna get old. And maybe we should skip the first chapters, Let the rest unfold. I’ve been thinking lately, This story’s getting old. (instrumental outro)",

You don’t know how it’s hard to understand, When you say you’ll always love me for who I am. You don’t see the shades of harm that I feel. When you watch me cry as I put my shoulder to the wheel. Shoulder to the wheel. She doesn’t notice consequences, She lives obliviously. The shadows brighten up her light, And darken everyone else. She floats away like a leaf. You don’t know how it’s hard to understand, When you say you’ll always love me for who I am. You don’t see the shades of harm that I feel. When you watch me cry as I put my shoulder to the wheel. Shoulder to the wheel. Can we get out of this town? Just disappear and never come back? Kill all the judges and the priests? Burn it to hell and surrender to no-one. We’ll run away and never be found, Live out our dreams and desires to the bright and black. Make our friends, kill off our enemies. Can we get out of this town? Just disappear and never come back? Kill all the judges and the priests? Burn it to hell and surrender to no-one. We’ll run away and never be found, Live out our dreams and desires to the bright and black. Make our friends, kill off our enemies. You don’t know how it’s hard to understand, When you say you’ll always love me for who I am. You don’t see the shades of harm that I feel.

I’m sorry I left, I don’t know what happened, But I love you more than the world, sweetie. I find flies in my skull, Bluebottle flies like a swarm unfold. Close our eyes, pray to above. Life is strange, but wild this river runs. Davey, boy, I ache for you in my core. I was just a child when you were born. And I wish I had been able to be a guardian angel, Be brave in the fight against the wardens. Angel, be brave. Angel, be brave. Angel, be brave. I find flies in my skull, Bluebottle flies like a swarm unfold. Close our eyes, pray to above. Life is strange, oh wild this river runs. Little things that change it all, Bitter men who hold a grudge. I’ll be sad to see us fall, When we held before the judge. Saints have peace, while sinners rule, But terror comes to those who harm. The weak will rise and break down the wall, The kids avenged, linked arm in arm. Charging, charged and ignited, Going swinging in, all of us united. Charging, charged and united, Going swinging in, all of us united.",

Has yours only just begun? I’m calling out, I’m here to help. Don’t beat yourself up, don’t get yourself down, It’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright. You’ve been alone, locked away, They told you were bad for the things, They refused to explain. It’s not your fault, child, You’re not to blame. Come on out, Come on out now, it’s okay, I’ll hold your hand, I’ll hold your hand, say it’s okay. The monsters have all gone away. What is this place? Why don’t I recognise it as home? Was I away? Where did you keep my broken bones? Why am I alive? What keeps me breathing at all? Damned if I cry, damned if I smile, time makes me feel so small. Time makes me feel so small. Turmoil and hate, I could never understand, How to plead my case, when I can feel blood on my hands? I’m only eight, a child in a way but fully grown, And death is awake, death is awake, awake in my soul. I’m calling out but I’m by myself, How can I trust you when you shut me out? I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone. What comes next after hell? Am I a demon that you just cast out with a spell? It’s my fault, I know it, I’m to blame. Pull me out, Pull me out of this spiral decay, Hold my hand, Hold my hand, say it’s be okay. Come on out, I’ll come on out, if it’s okay. Just hold my hand, Have the monsters all gone away? Have they all gone away? I am not alone and I am not dead. I am not sinful or sick in my head. There is no control but chaos can be fed. I am Angelo, I’m Angelo, the name you never said. I am Angelo, I’m Angelo, the name you never said. I am not alone and I am not dead. I am not sinful or sick in my head. There is no control but chaos can be fed. I am Angelo, I’m Angelo, the name you never said. I am Angelo, I’m Angelo, the name you never said. Blink in the light… I am Angelo, I’m Angelo, the name you never said.

But everything keeps crushing me, I ain’t built to pass the test. I was never gonna pass the test. Money’s tight and winter’s cold, Some of my friends might freeze. The queen is dead, there’s storms in my head, But the rich will do as they please. Sometimes I am scared to die, Other days I chase it. Late at night, wish I could cry, But I only drown when I’m wasted. Yeah, if I drown, I am wasted. What could have been? If I wasn’t what they made of me? What kind of light could I have seen? If they hadn’t drowned me in darkness with nothing to see? With nothing to see. You’ve been out at night a lot, I’ve been sleeping alone. Lose consciousness with the TV on, So the silence won’t take control. People talk and rumours spread, I try not to listen to it. But you do and you yell til I’m dead, And now everything is gone to shit. What could have been? If I wasn’t what they made of me? What kind of light could I have seen? If they hadn’t drowned me in darkness with nothing to see? With nothing to see. Ossie and I, we find our way. Ossie and I, we’ll find a way. Ossie and I, we’ll find a way. Ossie and I, we’ll find a way. Ossie and I, we’ll find a way, We hold each other through the cold. And I know that when the winter rules, Osnath will be there when we’re old. I still think of the fables we learned, When we were back in Sunday school. And when the final apocalypse comes, You and I, will feel so cool, lalala. Lalalala, lalala.",

And I know that it’s in me to be kind, To let you, oh, let you go this time. But I will hold you in the night-time, And I will sing you a lullaby. Do you remember? How this was the one you sang to me? When I was younger, and the shadows made me so afraid. But you would sing softly to me, and say “this is just a passing place,” And maybe death is just a passing place. I’m tuning out, can’t stand to hear. The constant sound, so loud, intruding my ears. I cry in the corridor, can’t hold myself up. I’m trying my best to be strong; I ain’t having much luck. But I know that it’s in me to be kind, To let you go, let you go this time. But I will hold you in the night-time, And I will sing you a lullaby. Do you remember? How this was the one you sang to me? When I was younger, And the dark made me so afraid. But you would sing softly to me, and say “this is just a passing place,” Maybe death is just a passing place. Now light’s fading from your eyes. To say goodbye, where is the will I must find? But I know that it’s in me to be kind, To let you go, to let you go this time. And I know that’s in me to be kind, To let you go, I’ll let you go this time. But I will hold you in the night-time, And I will sing you this lullaby. Do you remember? Well this was the one you sang to me. And I will tell you, “You have no need to be afraid.” “Cos you know as well as I do,” “That this is just a passing place,” “Yeah, death is just a passing place.” Yeah, death is just a passing place. And I know that it’s in me to be kind, So, I’ll let you go, I let you go… it was your time.",

Sometimes when I feel sad, I think about the times that once we had. But then I see that it faded away, But I'll hold out hope that you'll come back one day. Sometimes, ghosts are just like friends, That you've lost, you’ve forgotten or you regret. And sometimes, I look up at the moon, And I wonder, are you watching it too? What's the point in feeling blue? When the things you made me feel were so true. Yeah, you woke up a flower in my heart. It's cliche but somehow, that's the most genuine part of me. I will stand where you want me to be, I won't say no, I'll just tremble like a leaf. I will stay where you want me to be, I can say now, it's gonna be hard to breathe. It's gonna get hard to breathe without you. Without you. I will stand where you want me to be, I won't say no, I'll just tremble like a leaf. I will stay where you want me to be, I can see now, it's gonna be hard to breathe. It's gonna get hard to breathe without you. Without you.

Well, death comes for us all, At the end of time, But for now, eat up and enjoy the feast. Cos, it won't last forever, But together, there is something to see.

Carefully, They reach in And see, Their hands become eyes Their tongues become sirens Their touch becomes dust And here they must be gentle For here lies secrets and stories Humans are always sentimental Sentient kinds of creatures, Filled with love and kindness But allured by ego and violence. Innerexternal, What we know What we feel The chorus of every song Every photo on the reel And peel back the paper And open fate’s envelope, The corners are dark, the forests are wide, but the hand cannot grasp what the eye can capture and the souls of young gods are like flowers to grass, the universe spins in and out of itself while all life comes to pass and the borders of my being are immersed in your waters and you’ll tell me your stories and I’ll tell you mine.",

Sustain it for another ten years? Cos it is getting harder and harder, To breathe when it’s suffocating me. And out of the confines,  I will grow. I don’t wanna be so, I don’t wanna be so. I was caught in a net, I’m always moving too fast or too slow. I don’t wanna think back, when I’m older, And look back with regret and sorrow. And out of the confines, I will grow. I don’t wanna be so, I don’t wanna be so. And everyone I know will change, And hope for something more in their futures, But who will know? Who can tell? I feel like I’m in a living hell. And I don’t know, I don’t know what is wrong. Is it me or is it the world or is it both? Well, that’s a little bit, a little bit more frightening, Yeah, that’s a little bit, a little bit more frightening, Than I need in my life. And out of the confines, I will grow. I don’t wanna be so, I don’t wanna be so. I don’t wanna be so. I don’t wanna be so. I don’t wanna be so…",

I don’t wanna go and I don’t wanna talk, I don’t wanna do anything at all. Don’t wanna feel, I’m going to reel and throw up, In your sink, I threw up in your sink. I threw up, I threw up in your sink. I know you’re trying to help but, I just feel like a burden on you. And everything you do, Makes me feel a little bit more guilty.

And that everything you thought wasn’t that bad when you were a kid, It was that bad. And I know more than I let on. You might think I’m dumb, But I know more than I let on. Maybe I understand this world, A little bit more than you think I do. Maybe I’m the one, who knows more than everyone. I’m not trying to brag, I am not an arrogant twat, I just know myself and I’m not in denial of the world, And it’s all wrong. It’s all wrong. How can we belong? And carry on? Well, my clothes are made in shops that exploit kids. And my food travels across the globe and pollutes the sky. Our world is crying out, yeah, we’ll all gonna die, Or at least, this civilisation, will collapse into the sea and drown, Will we drown with it? What’s the point in complaining? I don’t know, I don’t know. What’s the point in trying to explain it? I don’t know, I don’t know. Is there even a point in singing this song? Isn’t this wrong as well? Cos, everything I am is just the things I’ve seen, And the things I’ve heard. The things I’ve felt and the things I’ve been told. Some things I’ve taken in as family, And others I’ve treated like enemies. I was to shake me and I’m about to blow. I’m a machine in control of what? Nothing at all. Nothing at all. What’s the point in playing notes that sound good, anymore? Cos it’s all just sounds in the end, it’s all just sounds in an ocean. And we are floating down, downstream, into a point, Into the ocean, floating out, floating further than we know. I don’t, I don’t know. I don’t, I don’t know, How to end this song, With no discernible direction. I’ll probably just fade out. I’ve made it too meta now. And I like my friends and I like my meals. But the storm is close, the storm is real. Yeah, I love my gran and I love my brothers. But why do I care for some? And not think a fuck about so many fucking others? It’s a joke, it’s a joke. It’s a joke.",

And all the waves crash upon the shore. Will we hope for more life? Will we hope for more life? Well, everything is temporary, Everything is temporary. Everything is temporary, Everything is temporary. Everything is temporary, Everything, everything, You and me, The universe, reality. I’ll be awake, are you? Can I talk to you? I know, I know it’s 4AM, And you’re probably dead asleep, But I need to hear your voice. I need to hear your voice. I’m crying in my sleep, crying in my nightmares. I’m crying when I wake and when I go down the stairs. I remember way too much, So, I forget it and then I regret not thinking about it so much, Cos maybe I’m faking all of this shit in my head, Maybe I was just screaming out for something, When I said I wanted to be dead, And I don’t feel so good. I don’t feel so good. I don’t feel so good. I don’t feel so good.",

Skeletal, fragile, like paper in the rain. Claustrophobic and covered in his bloodstains. I was just a child with an empty mind, But I was an accessory to a crime, And I knew it. Fuck it, it’s my fault,  I blew it. So, call me leper, call me a saint! Cover me with feathers and pitch-black paint. Swallow the poison and wallow in the pain, Practice patience, rehearse restraint.

Which one of us chooses what comes of us? I went to see him, Eight years down the line. Saw how the other kids treat him, Then that evening, I heard his father beat him. And though he tried to be kind, They didn’t know what he was meaning. And everyone was so demeaning, And the boy, kid took a beating. I’ve come to see the baby Judas, I’ve come to see what chooses, Our fates, in the end. I’ve come to see the baby Judas, I’ve come to see, What if we choose the ones that bleed? And those that lose it? I wonder what became of him. Maybe we become nothing.",

Every day, I try to think, About the days in which the water was rough, I thought that I might sink. I might drown and never breathe fresh air again, What would I do? What would I do then? Maybe I’m alone, maybe life is scary. Maybe I’ll feel low, maybe I can’t help it. Maybe I am cold, would you be here with me? Would you be a stronghold? Be my armour, be my dignity, be my safety. Be my safety. And I don’t know what I would do, Without you, without you. Yeah, I don’t know what I would do, Without you, without you.",

Somebody mumbled from inside my skull, And said, “I kinda wish I was dead.” Growing up and becoming depressed, Synonymous in my fucked up head. I can’t wait to live up north, I’ll climb the mountains every morning, Wandering across the moors, Talking to the rabbits and the fawns. Imagination takes my hand, I don’t want to, I don't want to understand. Imagination holds me tight, Till I can’t breathe in the poison sky. Growing up and becoming depressed, Synonymous in my fucked up head. Tried to laugh away all the dread, But it poisoned my soul, what did I expect? Growing up and becoming depressed, Became synonymous in my fucked up head. Tried to laugh away the dread, But it poisoned my soul, what did I expect?",

Look for an outlet, My fork fucking spoke, Now I am sitting in a church, With a cuppa leafy soup, Listening to amy 2, By the blessed mountain goats. Now, I wake up with scratches on my legs, God only knows what’ll happen next, Me and my angel having breakup sex. But I’m just overthinking my life again, And maybe Jesus Christ counts as a friend, Remember when we were just wee bastardly kids? Remember Leo, your Gonian imaginary friend? Let’s make a cuppa and sit by the fire, The devil’s a liar, but I’m alright, I’m made my amends, Peace of mind became my best friend. Cuppa leafy soup in my hands, And I don’t think about the end, That much anymore.",

I’m waking from this slumber, You’ve taken enough numbers, Of my years, so much of my life. I’ll rise above this fear of you before I die. I was locked in your cage, And instructed to sing, Then my bones you’d break, With your words as you curse me for my sin. And time is an arrow, marching ever forward, I was mesmerised by the mess of it all.",

I remember feeling high on believing, We will always be friends, We will always be best friends. I remember you singing, Wake me up, wake me up inside. I remember thinking are we really alright? But this life is deceiving, And death appears to be the only truth. I remember feeling high on believing, I’ll always have me and you. It’ll always be me and you. I remember you singing, Paradise city by guns and roses. I remember feeling scared, That the lid of my casket was closing. Cos the darkness inside me was opening. I remember hoping, hoping, That this fear would end, end. And you and I will always be best friends.",

When you call my phone, I pretend I’m not there, Cos I’m a fool,  and I can’t pick up the courage, To pick up the call. I wish you knew that I love you, But you don’t know anything, I feel about you at all. But don’t say you don’t miss me, Cos I’m pretty sure that you do, You called seventeen times this week. And though I’d love to hang with you, I don’t have it in me to go outside. I don't want to go outside.

They know it but they don’t know it, I’m a lonely girl. I may know it but I don’t show it, I’m a lonely girl. I'm a lonely girl, I'm a lonely girl. Everyone I meet says I’m different, And I don’t always know what they mean. I don’t understand these unwritten rules, I wasn't taught this shit in school. Sometimes, all I want to do is cry into my pillow, And just melt into my shadow, Turn me back to an animal. Loosen all the threads, I am stuck inside my head, I don’t want to end up dead, But I don’t want to look like this. I don't want to end up dead, but I don't want to live like this. They know it but they don’t know it, I’m a lonely girl. I may know it but I don’t show it, I’m a lonely girl. I'm a lonely girl. Would you free me from this prison? In this darkness, I need some light to shine through my prism. They know it but they don’t know it, I’m a lonely girl. I may know it but I don’t show it, I’m a lonely girl.

Under their thumb, we’re all in the line of the firing gun. Told you to run, the wolves of tyranny always come. They silence what is sung to free the blinded ones. Under their thumb, what’s left for humankind to become? Falling in love, only hate could claim a crime. It’s not damn enough, to give a little and say we’re fine. Just look at the numbers, look at every young one that dies For fear of the world outside, that see us as less than humankind, But who is really kind? And what is left behind? What is left behind? They take twice of all we have. They break your spirit til you’re desperate for half of that. The bastards are drunk on power, they’ve got guns and knives. They lock us up, for flowers and call it justice, what a fucking lie! They hold all the wealth, and cheat us of our healthcare, Leave us dead and blind. I want to cry, I want to scream into their thick old minds. Cos they take twice of all we have. They break your spirit til you’re desperate for half of that. Under their thumb, we’re all in the line of the firing gun. I told you to run, cos the wolves of tyranny always come. They silence what is sung to free the blinded ones.

When I’m crying, You’ll be gone and if you’re there, You will tell me to stop it, It ain’t gonna change a thing, My crying. Self-care is selfish, so you said. Do you care if I’m careless? Til I’m dead. Up the ramp, Up the ramp, Up the ramp… I start lying, Keeping the truth hidden away, I am smiling, Nobody sees that it’s fake. I’ve been trying, Not to look like I’m afraid. But I’ve been crying. Yeah, I’m crying. Self-care is selfish, so you said. But do you care if I’m careless? Til I’m dead. Up the ramp, Up the ramp, Up the ramp… Cold November,  Rainy Sunday afternoons. I remember singing loud out to the moon, And crying.",

When you cry out, I will hold you tight. Like you held me through the fiery night. There’s no surrender, it’s just play pretend. There’s no end, there’s no end. Look out, don’t call out for your mama. They will fight you down til you’d rather drown. Keep close, don’t lose hope, little brother. They’ll fall one day, we’ll make our escape, I promise. I promise. But do you see my face riddled with guilt and shame? Do you see my eyes filled with tears as you call my name? Am I still your friend? Do you still believe I care? Can we still find hope when we’re deprived of air? Look out, don’t call out for your mama. They will fight you down til you’d rather drown. Keep close, don’t lose hope, little brother. They’ll fall one day, we’ll make our escape, I promise. I promise. I promise... I promise. Cos there’s a graveyard full of secrets, I’ll take you there, I’ll take you there. Cos we’ve been dying, time and time again, Deprived of air, deprived of air. There’s a graveyard full of our feelings, You know I care, don’t you know I still care? And are we still dying? Well please live on in my mind. Deprived of air, deprived of mine.",

Don’t let me forget myself Don’t let me forget you I’m so full of regret  And yet nothing’s changed  But everything’s changed And I still really miss you Yeah I, I still fucking miss you, my mayfly spirit.

I needed a friend, So my mind played pretend, And fawned to be glad. That you took me in, And bathed me in sin, Til it twisted me mad. I’m waking up early to face the long day, Nobody knows me or wants me to stay, You take me for some food, You laugh at my jokes, make me feel good, I don’t want to leave your side, Or your room. I’ll be your servant, your pretty young thing, You lift me up high and call me your little prince, I’m broken open, open wounds are rotting, Memories I’ve forgotten, Locked away in the dungeons of my brain. Why, why can’t I cry? I’m not alive. I lied to stay alive. Why can't I cry? I'm not alive, I lied to stay alive. Why can't I cry? I'm not alive, I lied to stay alive. Why can't I cry? I'm not alive, I'm not alive... I still hear you say, Sometimes it’s ok, ok to cry. But this time, I know, It’s good to let go of the knife. Sometimes it’s ok, To feel this way, child, for a lie. So, I whisper to me, \"Kid, we’re finally free, and it’s safe to fly.\"",

Dreams I’ve had since I was small, Night turns black as darkness falls, But dawn will come after it all, And make way for something beautiful. Mesmerised, mesmerised. Mesmerised by the beauty of it all. By the beauty of it all.",

Guess, I’m not quite off this ride. You know I like music, maybe I’ll get into it,  A little bit more, but I already did before, When I was drowned in blue,  I feel I bonded to songs about suffering, While love was just something, keeping me going,  Now it’s a frightening thought, Like driving while it’s snowing, or driving at all, I don’t like to be placed in control, cos I don’t trust myself. I barely even know myself.  I tried to understand them, but it fucked my health. Get out of the door, go out for a walk,  Fresh air will do you good. But I’m a little sore, my body’s aching more,  I’m only 24, but I feel 82. I think I need a break, But I need more for heaven’s sake, Can’t stand it anymore, living life indoors, Even if spiritually I’m a housecat. What do I do now? I spent my whole life fighting for survival, But I feel clueless now I’m out. Free and free-falling, Woke up gone morning, I feel dead inside. Guess, I’m not quite off this ride. What do I do now? I feel clueless, I feel clueless, I feel clueless now I’m out. What do I do now? I feel clueless, I feel clueless, I feel clueless now I’m out. What do I do now? I spent my whole life fighting for survival, But I feel clueless now I’m out. Free and free-falling, Woke up gone morning, I feel dead inside. Guess, I’m not quite off this ride.",

I wanted to write a note, But it all came out trite. I think I’ll try to crawl, Maybe there’s something to find. I saw a film today, Well, in-between looking at my phone. Glanced up and the scene had changed, To a midnight train in the snow. He’s gonna be late, his girlfriend will have to wait, Just a little be longer. I think I’ll understand this scene, Better when I’m older. Guess the feeling is, I’m still a little kid like I’m lost in this world, Gotta learn how it works, or fall under its control. Guess the feeling like they always leave me reeling, Get my fingers to hold onto the page, But it keeps slipping away, Seems I’ll just have to learn, To keep my head on frontways. I heard a song today, And it reminded me of you, And how we used to play, When we got back from school. You hold the damage in your hands, Can you make a picture out of it? Give me something to believe in. I’m on a winding path, With blind corners and dead ends. I need a look-out to spy the way ahead. I hold the map in my hands, But I don’t know which way up it should be, How am I supposed to read it? Guess the feeling is, I’m still a little kid like I’m lost in this world, Gotta learn how it works, or fall under its control. Guess the feeling like they always leave me reeling, Get my fingers to hold onto the page, But it keeps slipping away, Seems I’ll just have to learn, To keep my head on frontways. But I don’t know anymore, You always watched my back when we were young. But where were you when I was crying on the floor? I think that it was pretty early on, That the fear began. Guess the feeling is I’m still a little kid, Like I’m lost in this world. Guess the feeling is I’m still a little kid, Like I’m lost in this world… Guess the feeling is, I’m still a little kid like I’m lost in this world, Gotta learn how it works, or fall under its control. Guess the feeling like they always leave me reeling, Get my fingers to hold onto the page, But it keeps slipping away, Seems I’ll just have to learn, To keep my head on frontways. Something has to change. Something has to change. Something has to change. Something has to change. But I don’t know what, And I don’t know how. But I don’t know what, And I don’t know how.",

I try to count my luck, Push it all away, Push it down a little further. Like mosquitoes in my brain, My thoughts fucking suck, And my energy they drain. I’m tired all the time, But I still stay up so late, I can’t remember to keep clean. And i’ve got way too many feelings Got me staring at the ceiling spinning out And this shit got way too real So I’m blocking out the memories I’m dipping out Call me when it’s over when I’m happy being sober  I'll be with you in a minute i swear I just got a little overwhelmed Everything bad rose and swelled Inside my head and it got me scared And it got me scared Love feels far away, Like a vague daydream, Or a scam in which in the end  You’ll pay double what you got for it, I cannot lie or sugarcoat it, Love is shit. Why do I feel this way? Oh, I cannot say, Please excuse my melancholy. I just wanna lie all day, In my bed and waste away, Is that so bad? You tell me. I’ve got way too many feelings Got me staring at the ceiling spinning out And this shit got way too real So I’m blocking out the memories I’m dipping out Call me when it’s over when I’m happy being sober  I'll be with you in a minute i swear I just got a little overwhelmed Everything bad rose and swelled Inside my head and it got me scared My mind never learns This repetition of crashing down and giving in My heart it fucking burns  I'm drinking Gaviscon from the bottle again Way too many feelings Got me staring at the ceiling spinning out And this shit got way too real So I’m blocking out the memories I’m dipping out Call me when it’s over when I’m happy being sober  I'll be with you in a minute i swear I just got a little overwhelmed Everything bad rose and swelled Inside my head and it got me scared My mind never learns, My mind never learns, My mind never, never learns.

So I tried to count all the doors, And as I searched, I found one more, Small as if for a child, And it was calling out to me. What could I do? But crawl on through, What was awaiting me? Bright and floating high, Like a balloon, I’m mesmerised by the moon. And we were drawn to this light, Now it’s too late to run. Took our souls through our eyes, When the thunder began. Now we’re just ghost kids, Got no bodies to live in, And there’s a spider’s web, That we’re all tangled up in. There’s no escape, Even from the outside. The world’s turned grey, Even if in desperation, You can stir it alive. Sometimes, I think there’s little left in hope, But I’ve seen hell up close, And heaven’s fake, so I’ll go, Running back, Wanting hugs but I’m a ghost. Now, on the other side, And how this world is bright and strange, A little too good to be true. The dreams I kept inside, Like a mum and dad radically changed, Out of their old shades of grey and blue. What could I do, but be drawn in? By all of the happenings and amazing colours, But is this for free? What would become of me? And we were drawn to this light, Now it’s too late to run. Took our souls through our eyes, When the thunder began. Now we’re just ghost kids, Got no bodies to live in, And there’s a spider’s web, That we’re all tangled up in. There’s no escape, Even from the outside. The world’s turned grey, Even if in desperation, You can stir it alive. Sometimes, I think there’s little left in hope, Cos I’ve seen hell up close, And heaven’s fake, so I’ll go, Running back, Wanting hugs but I’m a ghost. I’m a ghost. I’m running back, Wanting hugs but I’m a ghost. I’m a ghost, Running back, Wanting hugs… But I’m a ghost.",

Cos I know where you hide, Cos I’ve hidden there before. And I hope you’ll subside, Your defences a little more. Cos I’m only trying to help you, To leave the confines inside. Can you reach out, take my hand? Bring you out of our mind. Leave a note, I’ll read it soon. I’ll watch the sun like you watch the moon. Shadows live beside their light. Can I bring out of our mind? I’ve been working at this skill, Constructing dimensions at will. Places to hide in my head, When the real world is a little too real, And filled with horror and dread. Now I’m walking along a beach, But the shoreline’s still a little out of reach. I need someone to show me the way, Up the stone steps, to a home where we’re safe. And you know where I hide, Cos you’ve hidden here before. And I want to subside, My anxieties a little more. How can I know I can trust you? After every betrayal and lie. But I reach out, take your hand, Bring me out of our mind. I leave a note for you to read, It’s in this song, a secret reply. I carry with me with all my harms, Welcome me with open arms. Welcome me, welcome me, Welcome me with open arms. Welcome me, welcome me. I leave a note to say to you, I’ll be here when you ready, alright? I know the sea was rough but now it’s calm, I welcome you with open arms. I welcome you with open arms.",

When the wind blew, I fell right through, Catch me, brother, before I descend to a plane, Of insanity, balancing the love and the hate, Inside my wee sickly brain. I remember you singing, Wake me up when September ends. I remember feeling high on believing, We will always be friends, We will always be best friends. Well we were brothers, But I was younger and caught up in gunfire, In long hill town and out there somewhere, Where a forest of falling trees, Were falling down hard on me. And I was running down the street, Stupid and sleepless, Weeping in buckets from the beach. Down in Cornwall, Even paradise is a pair of dice, In my teeth. I remember you singing, Wake me up, wake me up inside. I remember thinking are we really alright? But this life is deceiving, And death appears to be the only truth. I remember feeling high on believing, It’ll always be me and you. I will always have you two. I remember you singing, Paradise City by Guns and Roses. I remember feeling scared, That the lid on my casket was closing. Cos the darkness inside me was opening. I remember hoping, hoping, That this fear would end, end. But you and I, Yes you and I would always be best friends. Iris of my eye, Don’t you know? You were the first love of my life.",

Did I say already I missed ya? Had a dream a few weeks ago, I think. You and I were on a mountain, Climbing up a steep, sheer cliff. You wanted to dive into the water, I wanted to hold onto the warmth. You went ahead and soon I followed, Cos I ain’t letting you go, anymore. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let me be young, forever more. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let me be young, forever more. Forever more. Forever more. Went around to yours this evening, Found you crying on your bedroom floor. Tried to cheer you up but no laughter, You just ask, “what is any of this for?” I can’t answer without lying, So all I say is, “I’ve been there before” Sometimes, this life feels like a prison We’re just fish in a bowl swimming In circles, but with you I’m certain, That I am happier than I’ve ever been, Every day, I can wake up renewed. And though darkness still surrounds us, One day, we’ll get out, it’ll be just me and you. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let me be young, forever more. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let us be young, let us be young. Let us be young, let us be young. You wanted to dive into the water, I wanted to hold onto the warmth. You went ahead and soon I followed, Cos I ain’t letting you go, anymore. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let me be young, forever more. Never gone, I’m forever yours, Let me be young, let us be young. Let us be young, let us be young. Cos I am happier than I’ve ever been, Every day, I can wake up renewed. And though darkness still surrounds us, One day, we’ll get out, it’ll be just me and you.",

Bumping into one another, You don’t show mercy when you’re dealing with these types. Gotta laugh it off like brothers, But if they plan to kill you, they won’t tell you twice. We’ll be running at our top speed, Down the dusty lanes and through the dirty backstreets, Muddy palms on our bruised up and grazed knees, Shit never happens in suburbs like these. Anyone who isn’t frightened, Is either drugged or damn enlightened. You’ve got some moxie, but it’ll earn you nothing But a bucket of blood squeezed out of your suffering. Everybody here is armed to the teeth, Maybe only with words, but my god, it’s enough. Just one look and I can see that they’ve all got guns, And I know that this is gonna go rough. We’ll be running at our top speed, Down the dusty lanes and through the dirty backstreets, Muddy palms on our bruised up and grazed knees, Shit never happens in suburbs like these. There’s a new kid at the factory, Kinda scrawny and missing a few teeth. Gotta keep him safe in a relative sense, Guess it’s only time before we’re all dead. They stick the flour in the backseat, No-one looks there, that’s what they tell us. Just another little secret to keep, Kind of easy to do when you’re forgetful as fuck. We’ll be running at our top speed, Down the dusty lanes and through the dirty backstreets, Muddy palms on our bruised up and grazed knees, Shit never happens in suburbs like these. They say, shit never happens, in suburbs like these. One, you’ve got to keep quiet. Two, you better run and hide if you hear sirens. Three, you should always be obedient, And if you fuck it up, You can bet they won’t be lenient. We’ll be running at our top speed, Down the dusty lanes and through the dirty backstreets, Muddy palms on our bruised up and grazed knees, Shit never happens in suburbs like these. They say shit never happens in suburbs like these, And definitely not to a kid like me.",

Where the water freezes up on the playground structures, And we’d break the icicles off and let our hands grow cold. Running back in and running hot water over our fingers. Burning to the touch. Burning, burning. And the corridor was stretching out, In front of my eyes, yeah, they were full of doubt, Cos I couldn’t see, and I couldn’t believe, That everything would be okay. The silence is the worst, the hurt is second, The shiver down my neck as she beckons me. I have a way out, I am not here in my head. I am dreaming, floating away instead. And I am dreaming of heaven. Running down a hill, Tripping over my feet and standing up still. Lonely sad kid pondering life, From the windowsill. What can I get when I can’t get out of this rut I’m in? What’s there to gain from the suffering? Is it all in vain? Everything will be okay.",

I’m always looking around for you, On these murky moors. We rush down to the coastline, Look, how death is close by. Share a cigarette in daylight. And maybe, life is lonely, And maybe, death seemed tempting, Or maybe, there is something more. We tasted it, once before, It was sweet and salty on our tongues. Rough and real and raw and coarse, Moved through us like poison when we were young. I’ve been looking over all these shores, In our youth what was never won, Was the eternity of the pure, As soon as it bloomed, it was gone, Forever, But didn’t we try to make happy? With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. I found you in the old barn, You were steps away from paradise, Or hell, I don’t know. You scold me when I try the same, The rope to starve the brain, Hypocrisy, it’s a name you keep close. Well, time is like a dragon, Feeding off our sadness, To dream up our dreams, Ancient Leviathan. And maybe, I was a dreamer, And you were stuck here believing That only your nightmares could come to life. But the silence gets too hard to bear, When every time I call out your name, Some days it’s like you’re not even there, Even when I’m leaning on your bedframe. What if in the night, I was to shake your shoulder, What would I do if you didn’t wake? Wouldn’t I be running down to the creature, I’m speechless without the space, To fathom, Oh, just what kind of torture, Could have them all, And blow out all our torches, Forever, We were just trying to feel happy, With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. Did I ever make you smile in Whale Valley? Did I ever make you smile? We tasted it, once before, It was sweet and salty on our tongues. Rough and real and raw and coarse, Moved through us like poison when we were young. I’ve been looking over all these shores, In our youth what was never won, Was the eternity of the pure, As soon as it bloomed, it was gone, Forever, But didn’t we try to make happy? With whatever, Could make us smile in Whale Valley. Did I ever make you smile in Whale Valley? Did I ever make you smile? Well, time is like a dragon, Feeding off our sadness, To dream up our dreams, Ancient Leviathan.

We grew up, learned some shit the hard way, But we knew what would keep us strong through anything, You and me, but you’re not the same today. I crashed the car, you said it wasn’t my fault. My mother fell to shit and I heard it all. Hours went by and I was all on my own. You never visited me once in the hospital. We sped out, driving off to anywhere, But here and now, the world was flying by in a blur, I was scared that you would never care for me quite the same. The truth is, I never thought of you as more than a friend, I tried but something isn’t there and to force it, Would just be lying to you and I. I crashed the car, you said it wasn’t my fault. My mother fell to shit and I heard it all. Hours went by and I was all on my own. You never visited me once in the hospital. You never visited me once. And the words that you said, They were just in my head it seems. A memory of who you were. I didn’t know you were gone, Til they let me go home. Now my whole body’s numb. Now I know why, You never visited me once. Now I know why, You never visited me once. You never visited me once. You never visited me once… I crashed the car, you said it wasn’t my fault. My mother fell to shit and I heard it all. Hours went by and I was all on my own. You never visited me once in the hospital. You never visited me once. Now I know why. Now I know why.

I hear the volumes of the readings now, slowly turning me insane. I see the costume of the castaway, Hanging up in my garden now. What is there to parade in town? To feel the cold against your skin is wild. And when the wind blows does it feel like ice? Time to tune the strings to those of a child. Do you remember how it felt at night? Like insects crawling on your skin. You tried to rip the flesh from under your eyes, But it’s a vicious creature within. Well, it’s all so very clear, And then it’s all so very strange. Cos I feel love like it could conquer every fear, And then I’m spiralling and getting lost inside my brain. Life is short and crude and bitter. Death is long in the minds of the living. Death is longest in the minds of the living. Water runs through my veins, When the blood grows stale. There were words I wanted to say, But in the last light they have grown pale, Once more. Once more…",

Always caught in the space between lines. Always walking a distance behind. In the morning, please tell me I’m right, To be kind to the coldest sunrise. I’ll be kind.

Tell me I’m right, Tell me I’m right before it’s too late. What is this crime? What are you crying for, for heaven’s sake? Cos, everything is fine! I promise that everything is fine, Just give me a minute. And I will be alright, I will be alright, just cut out the bullshit. Cos, I’ve been alone inside of my mind. For far too damn long, I’ve lost some light. Even when my eyes aren’t closed, I can’t see anything, it’s always night. So, would you hold me close and say I’m alright? Would you hold me close and say I’m alright? Say I’m alright. Say I’m alright. Say I’m alright… Say I’m alright.",

Like I’m dead inside my body, And I’m losing sight of my soul. My spirit’s all contorted, And I feel like I’m in a deep dark hole. Can you let me out? I just need to breathe… And the colours drown and fade out. And I am drowning deep. What can I say? I fucked it up. I stubbornly tried it my own way, And made a mess of our love. I want you to see that I’m not a bad guy. But I fall and slip underneath the ice. Would you let me breathe? Cos, this air, this ain’t right for me. And I am drowning deep in the core, Of the earth. Would you hold me close? There’s nothing I need, But to feel your wind in my hair, And your bone on my cheek. Can you lead me out of this deep ocean? I am swimming in. Cos, I’ve been dreaming of summer, Since I was just thirteen. I want to breathe in the daylight, Drink it in. But the cave I’ve been in, I am scared that the tide is high still. Can you pull me out of here? Cos, I want to feel the sunshine on my skin. And everywhere I turn, I get lost in the in-between. So, can you pull me out and hold me clean? Can you call me out of this cave I’m in? Summer, summer’s beckoning. (Ocean Eyes V3) This is the way that it falls, Sun on the first morning of summer. Everything is new, everything is pure. And everything we knew will die, And oceanize. Hold it in, hold it in. I’m sure we’ll find a way. You’ll be your younger thing, Always on its eyes. You can go in your own way, Don’t feel you have to be someone that you’re not. And you can rise out of this abyss, And wipe away your ocean eyes. What a year we’ve seen, And we have been so far in our minds. Is there anything left behind to fight? So, wipe away your ocean eyes. And wipe away your ocean eyes. And wipe away your ocean eyes. And wipe away your ocean eyes.",

And when it’s cold out, I’m wrapped up in blankets. Just like you. Don’t hold back with your love. There’s so much pain in this world already. So, fill it up with light, Try to find some beauty; there’s plenty. And take your place up in the sky. Fly out into the forest. Try out, there’s so much for us to explore here. I’m turning out in the moonlight. And I wonder, I really wonder, If this world will be alright. If it will make it another night. And when darkness comes over my heart, I hope that I can make it home again. And when the past just tears us apart, I hope that I will have a friend. But I won’t fear the end. When it’s dark and when I’m scared, I try to find a little peace of mind. And when I’m lost and unprepared, I’ll look right through, And I dream of you.",

We start again, it seems. We fight our way through hurt and pain, And come out on the other side, scathed. You saw that life was full of battles. To the wind, tonight, And you would hold us through the weather. Mother to mother, Guardian over all the earth. Mother to mother, Stay close in our hearts forever. Stay close in our hearts. Don’t let time tear it all apart. Mother to mother, Hold us close even though you are gone. I’ll see you soon, I’ll see you soon, I promise, In my prayers and my dreams, You are there like you were always, it seems. Mother to mother.",

I try to stand up tall, But the truth is that I’m just fucking small. I am just a boy. I’m turning in my grave. I’ll say a prayer for us all, Because no-one can be saved, If they don’t want it. Can you turn me out? Cos I’m scared somehow, I will fall away. And I stay up and try to work out solutions, But there’s nothing I can come up with or say, That’ll make you stay. And the daylight falls away. And I’m trying my best to stand up straight. But my knees buckle under the weight.",

I’m caught in the long grass, I’m caught in the grass, where I think there are snakes. I try to be calm, I try to be calm but there’s so much here at stake. And life blossoms lies in my head, Time falls and turns me red. When all’s said and done, I’m gone, And you were one I was hoping for, But you’re already gone. Can we turn away from here? And start anew. Find some fresh ground, And build a new place to settle down, We see the sun come up and the sun go down. And there’s no-one I’d rather be with than you. Cos, you make me feel happy and free from the truth. We can just make believe and play pretend. And you make me believe that this will never end. I don’t want this to ever end.",

Walk out onto the grass, I go down to the hut, I want to sit at the round table. And you can tell me how I can get myself a can, Of whatever, and I will, because I’m seven. And life is so much better with a little bit of a spark. Oh, I don’t know how to say goodbye now. Oh, I don’t know how to say goodbye now. To say goodbye now. I still see you there, Smoking at the dining room table. And I feel the fresh air, As I walk around the garden, Trying to find apples. I will watch the fish swim up and down, In the pond, Because I know, That this world is just one, There’s more beyond. I… I don’t know how, How to say goodbye now. How to say goodbye now. How do I say goodbye? How do I say… …Goodbye. for grandma x",

Well he gathered all his coins and blew it all on a machine. Hoped he could win something, whatever that may mean, His mind was growing tired and his eyes were going. It was summer when he entered, when he left there, it was snowing. Why should I lie to my friends? I’ll tell them it’s all over, It’s all over again. Mind, is a tricky thing, friend, It’ll tell you it’s over, It’s all over again. I know it’s the end. Once I saw a girl in conversation with a pear. She asked, how did you grow so very sweet in this air? I haven’t really breathed very well this past year. I’m scared to go outside and I’m consumed by my fear. Life tends to frighten me, friend. I feel it’s all over, It’s all over again. I try, but all I do is pretend, That it isn’t really over, But I know it’s over in my head. I know it’s the end. Once I saw a boy in conversation with a cloud. He pondered its ability to hover above the ground. The sight was so unnerving that his eyes began to cry. What exactly he was crying over, he couldn’t quite say why. Death, is a morbid word, friend, For saying it’s over, It’s all over again. Blue, is the colour of my mind, Gone, butterfly, to the star-line, above me, I’m cowering like an insect. Terror comes and hugs me too tight. Light in the window, too bright. Terror comes and hugs me too tight. Light in the window, light in the window too bright. Light in the window too bright. And I know it’s the end. I know it’s the end. I know it’s the end.",

There was little for us to do, So, we just watched the branches move, In the gentle August wind. I felt low but you don’t see it. We sat around and looked away, Watched the wildlife and how it plays, Does this ever feel natural? I don’t know how to act natural. Paint the sky in colours of red, I felt a deep kind of sad when you said, “I think I might go home now.” But I felt more alone before somehow. I don’t know why but I, Felt a little ignored. When you said you liked me when I smiled, Just a little more. And it’s not unlike me to hide, So, it’s not all your fault, But you know I’m trying to be honest, So, it feels like I’m being punished, For the result. And I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I was bored when you called me along, Sat by your side but didn’t really belong, I walked a mile in the rain for you, I walked a mile in the rain for you, Sat by your side but didn’t really belong, I walked a mile in the rain for you. I don’t know why but I, Felt a little ashamed. When you said, “You’re all stressed out and isolated these days.” And it’s not unlike me to be shut off, Yeah, I know that statement holds some truth, But lately, I’ve noticed I’m more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own. I feel more alone with you, Than I do on my own.",

You probably think that I’m okay, And don’t panic, I’m relatively safe, But there’s some demons close behind. And they’re so loud, And no matter what I do, I can’t drown them out. It seems you’re never about, And I know I’m exaggerating that, But their noise keeps growing, every day. Off and on, turning around, Feeling unwelcome in my own house. Always shy but stupidly loud, Either I’m a child or I bring it down. Tearing up, once again, I can hear them saying my name, Too emotional, too sensitive, “No it doesn’t bother me”, “No it doesn’t bother me”, I’ll pretend like I don’t mind. Oh, I don’t mind. Every now and then I think, A little too deeply and I sink, Into my thoughts like a lake of tar. And I don’t who to turn to when, Shit hits the fan like this again, I feel I’m always about to break. Off and on, turning around, Feeling unwelcome in my own house. Always shy but stupidly loud, Either I’m a child or I bring it down. Tearing up, once again, I can hear them saying my name, Too emotional, too sensitive, “No it doesn’t bother me”, “No it doesn’t bother me.” And I feel so guilty, You’ve done so much for me, But I’m still no better. I’ve been like this for more than years, I’m starting to think that I’m the poison in me, And I won’t get better at all. But I don’t mind. I don’t mind. Don’t mind.",

It’s not much of a shock but it’s running my plans for now. And I’m losing time and I’m losing the will. Cos every time I try, I try to try, But nothing comes from it. It’s breaking me down, it’s breaking me. What is there left now? Am I the clown of this village? Keep your head down and get on. Keep your head down and get on. Don’t think about it too much, Don’t overthink it, Even though it is so clearly fucked. Don’t let it get to you. Don’t let it possess your mind. Cos one day you are thinking too long, The next, you’re left behind. You just gotta keep your head down and get on. Gotta keep your head down and get on. Gotta keep your head down and get on.

I know I’ve said it before, But it’s gotta be reinforced somehow. Don’t be a clown. And I’m just a puppet with my head sewn up. I mean nothing, I mean nothing. I’m just a puppet and my mouth is zipped up. I’ll say nothing, I’ll say nothing, Nothing now. (instrumental break) It is chaotic that we’re all alive, On this planet, spinning wild. We don’t fall off, we don’t fall off, It is nice, But it’s dreadful in a billion other ways, Don’t you see now? Trapped in this ocean of plastic, Floating into my lungs, How had this begun? I don’t feel so good anymore. I don’t feel so good. And I’m just a puppet with my head sewn up. I mean nothing, I mean nothing. I’m just a puppet with my mouth zipped up.

And they’ve got boots that look nice, And shirts that are sold at an absurd price, And it’s all my mind, money. Don’t care twice, look the other way tonight, You’ll find happiness when you least expected to find it. Let’s get ice cream for dinner. Wear a smile and you’re a winner. We’ll drink coke out of our cups, Cos I’m a mumma fox and these are my kit cubs. And I’m a puppet with my head sewn up, And I mean nothing, I mean nothing. And I’m a puppet with my mouth zipped up, And I mean nothing and I’ll say nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing…",

In the distance, in this sordid light, I was wandering so lost. Wrapped my scarf around my hands twice, Upon my cheeks was forming frost. From the view of watching magpies, I was alone and a bitter old kid, Trampling branches and nettles, And tripping over roots, I was surely ignorant. And my mind and my body grew tired, I could feel my confidence paling. There was fear in my dampening eyes, As I realised, I was failing. Where will I go? When the world has spat me out, And all that’s left is this tar and my doubts. If I was to knock on your door? Would you open it slowly? Would you hold me close once more? I won’t ask for much, But a bed to rest my head, And a house so warm. The strangers round here are vicious, Violent creatures with no kindness. These are the ones that come on passing by, Looking up into the sky. And I know that I wasn’t perfect, But oh lord, is this to be kind? To tear away my innocence? And leave me bare and blind. Yet I will call on you in the morning, You can dwell upon this street, And I’ll be there at the same hour, I pray that we will meet. Where will I go? When the world has spat me out, And all that’s left is this tar and my doubts. If I was to knock on your door? Would you open it slowly? Would you hold me close once more? I won’t ask for much, But a bed to rest my head, And a house so warm. (instrumental break) Where will I go? When the world has spat me out, And all that’s left is this tar and my doubts.

Looking for an out, wandering about, Rabid like a dog foaming at the mouth. Shout into the void, “I am just a boy!” But what is the point? Could somebody calm me down? Asking twenty questions to work out who I am. Childish protection, it doesn’t work as planned. Stare at my reflection, for as long as I can. Look into my eyes, is there something there to hand? Breaking points and white noise, I will never understand. Branches of a tree, reaching out of me, Trying to find a hideaway in the green. I remember you, do you remember me? I’m 22, while you’re stuck at thirteen. Shattered like glass, it happened so fast, I will never last, unless I fade and fold. Trying to stay calm, clinging to your arm, Look at who we are, now, so young and so old. Is there a way out? Is there a way out for me? Is there a way to set me free?",

Children starving, drowning in the ocean. “That’s old news”, they said, “we’re already over it.” Face down in the sand, I think I should add, “Nothing to see here,” they laughed. And it makes me so sad. Because this is where humanity is at. And it makes me so mad. It’s so shit, and this is it, apocalypse. Saved our precious lives and now it’s failing, But Rishi’s always right, he’s gonna save it! I said why not distribute the wealth a little bit? Little kid, it’s far more complicated. Planet’s on the brink, it’s all collapsing, Down the kitchen sink, it’s already happening. “we’re all in the same boat,” But this one cannot float. The hypocrisy and idiocy are maddening.",

It’s too late to change the path we’re on, it’s fate. Who am I to walk away? Who am I to decline responsibility? What is life if not learning from mistakes? Turn in the light, burn down the city. Everybody staring down, don’t look up, please don’t look now. Terrified to speak out the truth that’s on our lips. Wandering the ghostly town, no future here to be found. Little bits of diamonds thrown to cloud your judgement, kid. “Make it easy on yourself, deny the facts for the good of your health. Govie’s got deep pockets, right? Dependable levels of wealth! Have some faith, they do their best! Put your anxieties to rest! Can’t you see, kid, that we’re blessed? Stop stirring it up, you pest.” Who am I to defend the light of day? Who am I to pretend the future’s safe? What is life if not fighting for tomorrow? Dying in the sunlight, dying in the shadows. Money’s not the issue here, ignorance will cost us dear, I see landscapes changing in the blink of an eye. What the hell do I tell my kids? “There used to be these things called rainforests!” Take them to the Amazon Canyon, everything alive has died. Bury all your thoughts of rage, cause fighting just creates more pain. What do we need? Well, what do you mean? I’m just 22, and forget to eat food, Think I’ll just leave and spark a light. Don’t wanna think about all this insanity tonight. Who am I to turn my back? Who am I close my eyes upon the bad? What is life anymore? We take and we take, always wanting more. And I am tired, so tired of it all. I would like to go back, to a time that was simpler. I would like to go back, to a state of innocence. I would like to go back, to a time that was easier. I would like to go back, to the bliss of ignorance. I would like to go back.. Sunflowers and sunshine hours hum to me. Numb and sour, time to leave the city.",

Loose ends I’ve been trying to mend, Lost myself when I lost my friend. Turning blue inside my head, Listening out for the song of the dead. I don’t know where to turn to now, Yet, I’ve been through this before, somehow, And I’ve forgotten, the keys. And I’ve got to get free, I follow the sound. Always, so afraid, Of nightmares, wee hellscapes, Tell me, tell me I’m safe, Here, where the daylight fades. Whisper words of comfort to me, Saying “god will set us free” Terror comes from every side, Turning numb in the face of the night. Through the storms and through the hail, Winter came, I still prevailed. I’ll be there when demons die, Songs in my heart means hope in my eyes.",

Break my back, carrying the world. Topple the stack, it’s not yours alone. Everybody’s making mistakes, you’re not the first, To think they’re the worst. The sun will rise again, you will see. When the world grows quiet, I can feel every blade of grass. When the world grows quiet at last. Will you be here with me? To watch and see it all go pass. Riots in the streets, why do we fight? Echo and release, the fire inside. And everyone here wants to burn, From left to right. Anger’s a waste, of truth and purpose. Just a wind we chase, til the final curtain. I’m seeking an easy escape, I cannot contain, The words I’d say, if someone could hear my cry. See yourself as you are. Build a shelf for your past. Cos sometimes, you read for too long, And forget where you belong, All that is gone, yet here you are.",

I try my best, The fear of failing doesn’t hold me anymore. But I’m still looking through the window, Locked behind the door. And I fall to the floor. Waiting for the winter, Waiting for the summer, Anywhere I am I just want to leave. Pretty sure I don’t fit, Feel like I don’t exist, Half of my secrets, you wouldn’t believe. Always scared, Tired of thinking everyone’s against me, Tired of trusting the wrong people, you see. Tired of wasting time on enemies. But does anyone know? Where the heavens hide. Because I was drawn to this amber glow, But now it’s night. They took my friend, I don’t know when I’ll get to see him again. Suffice to say this isn’t the first time it’s happened. I’m always losing everyone I love, When is it enough? What the hell is this? Lost my faith in justice, got to admit, The human race is making me damn sick. I think I want to run away from this, But my legs are frozen stiff, I know, I can’t go. Save me the fall from hope, And tell me it’s already broke. Every well is going dry, And I’ve always felt alone. Tell me where the heavens hide, I’m tired of this world. All I ask, take me home. All I need, make me whole. Feel the grass of Mother Earth. Help me breathe, hold me close.",

I listened to the water rippling down to the lake, The mountainside is calling out your name. I’m losing this game against the wind, It’s throwing me back down again. Life is taking the mick out of me. I’m fine with it, I laugh it off, Don’t take it all so seriously. Why walk in circles? Colliding at the breach, All my dreams were born on the water’s surface. Lessons taught and learned, all the way home. Tried to think about the beauty that goes unseen. Chasing pigeons in the park, Listening to that old lab’s bark, I’m dreaming with my eyes open, it seems. Find out the secrets of the universe, They all call out to you, The sound is louder in the blue. Follow it into the green. Stronger every day, some things go my way, I am grateful for these moments of sanctuary.",

What are you going to make of yourself? Staring down the barrel of a gun. When I was younger, I used to stare straight into the sun. And it didn’t ruin my eyes, or maybe it did, Just a little bit, but I never realised. And everything is changing, And change is the only constant here. Yeah, everything will be changing, And it’s already changing, So, don’t fear. “It will be like this forever”, What a lie that was, that we were all told. We always think that this will last forever, But it ain’t true at all. Our minds change, our bodies decay, We grow and we change, we grow and we change. We never stay the same, That is the way of all things, That is the way. And everything will change, Yeah, change is the only constant here. Everything will be changing, And it’s already changing, So, don’t fear. Don’t fear.",

What did they make of me? Well, I bet they didn’t notice, and if they did, They just thought there’s nothing to see. [Verse 2] Well, time is an ocean and we,  We are drowning here, Surrounded by loved ones and conquering fear. Well, are we really?  Or are we lying to protect ourselves? Our egos in fragile shells. [Verse 3] This is the recipe, This is the mess you made, And I’m standing at the bed that’s still unmade. Sitting in my pyjamas, And watching weather through a screen. [Verse 4] And by autumn, it’ll be over, that’s what they said. But summer came and summer went. And the new year’s almost at our door, Have we learned anything?  Or are we still yearning for more? [Outro] This is the recipe, This is the recipe, This is the recipe, This is the recipe for nothing at all.",

I see you every day, I see you when I’m awake, I see you when I’m asleep, In my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams. And I’ll hold you close, And I’ll hold your coat as you wait in the rain for me. And I’ll be there, When you need me, I’ll be there, for you, for you. For you…",

You can go in your own way, Don’t feel you have to be someone that you’re not, And you can rise out of this abyss, And wipe away your ocean eyes. What a year we’ve seen, And we have been so far in our minds. Is there any doubt left behind to fight? And wipe away your ocean eyes. And wipe away your ocean eyes. And wipe away your ocean eyes.

And I was thinking to myself, About the things that I couldn’t comprehend, All the things that I couldn’t comprehend, And how they were gnawing at my brain. And when I awoke, To the sound of you fleeing, I didn’t know where to run or turn, I didn’t know who to trust or what to think. And it scared me out of my bed, And it scared me out of breath, And I was talking to this lonesome sailor by the docks, And he said: “You know, what you get you don’t return,” “and what you know you won’t forget”, “and what you know you already know;” “for this old war is going on for so long,” “and no side wins, yeah, no side wins.” I don’t want to be your own father, I don’t want to be your own mother. I don’t want to be your only friend. I don’t want to be your oldest enemy. I don’t want to be the one you turn to for advice. I don’t want to be the one you always kinda despise. I don’t want to be the one you hire for a job. I don’t want to be the one you ever will hope is wrong. Cos you always admire me, But from a distance, you despise me. Yeah, you always admire me. From a distance, you despise me. And how long will it take? For you to admit this is the way our love goes.",

Fall… Well, I went over to my gran’s. And we hugged despite the circumstances. And I hung up her decorations for Christmas. Yeah, I hung up her decorations for Christmas.",

All the things that they won’t admit in the daylight hours, Come to life. And I don’t know why, I guess I find it nice. But every time the sun shines on dandelions, On the grass verge, verges of this town, I lose a little bit of my frown. And though it’s cliché, That doesn’t make it not true. It may be irrational, But I can’t help loving you. Everyone sees the dawn, Even if it comes too early to see with your eyes. There’s a little piece of it left for you to digest with your mind. The curtains are all drawn, By the time the music starts. And when I awake, I’ll be gone by the morning, And when you say, That you never knew how I belonged, Well, this is how, this is how: With you, by my side. Holding my hand at midnight, As I rock and cry, you will be there, Saying it will be alright.",

And I know, that what comes of us all; Return to dust, return to dust. What will we outgrow? Oh, nothing. Oh, nothing, oh, nothing.",

The tyrants in their houses, They ain’t gonna listen, Til this shit starts affecting them, And by then, it’ll be too late. The warming and the wars And all the division that remains, The violence of our histories, These are our chains to break. And I am scared, That nothing will ever be enough. That the world as we know it, Is already lost. And I’m afraid, that the planet we love, Will kill us off for our mistakes. Tell yourself what you want, But we know now, We are the ones to blame.",

The broken toenails, And bruised-up shins, The bundle of soft ones, That you cry in to. You little monster, Silent and screaming, You’ve got two shoulders And they’re slowly breaking. It’s all you’ve known And yet you still hope for something better, There’s something better and you know it. I freeze without cold And I wait out the moments, They rot and make me old, But I’m still hoping, And yet it takes its toll, And yet I smile as it’s snowing, We’re taking go’s, Sledging down the road. I’m a little monster, Half silent, half screaming, I’ve only two shoulders And they’re constantly shaking. It’s all I’ve known, And yet I still hope for something better, There’s something better and I know it. I ain’t breaking, I’m just evolving, From the hellhole that you trapped me in. I never had too much sin, To be loved and I know I’m enough, I am more than you could ever begin, To comprehend, you small thing, That I feared, that I cried over, And over, I am starting over, With the insight that I’m worth living. And I’ve got a world to be in now.",

To venture in land and out to sea. Be a better kind of free, Learn your lessons, teach them to me. Cos everyone I know is, Growing old and next in line is me. You hear what you’re told, Brainwashing for free, Childhood was cold and I’m still a wean on a lead. Still a wean on a leash. We're breaking momentum on the road, Shaking oak trees for the leaves of gold. Better take your time as it goes, Better make your mind up quick as hell, though. See the way the sea waves roll, Feel the heatwave on your skin boil. Better dead than alive alone, Better depressed than a lying fool. Cos anyone I ask says, Growing up is a hard place to be caught. Well, time enough is bullshit, A dumb fairy tale of time well spent, It’s all airy thought. And I’ve spent too many hours, Thinking about time itself. Time wasted on time wasted on myself. My mind is a scary old place to dwell. It has its highs less than its wells, And they’re often dry and burn like hell. Time wasted on time wasted on time itself. I’m wasted on my wasting of time itself. Time wasted on time wasted on myself. Life’s wasted on time wasted on myself. Cos anyone I ask says, Growing up is a hard place to be caught. Well, time enough is bullshit, A dumb fairy tale of time well spent, It’s all airy thought. Cos everyone I know is, Growing old and next in line is me.

Take them in hold, For it’s you that they will suffocate, A knot around your throat. And what did you see? When you really listened, To the scared thing that breathes, It’s broken but it’s living. Shoved into a corner, Neglected like a lie. But it’s part of me and I can’t ignore, And in a way, It’s my own soul that survives.",

We laughed as we drank, Our feet always dangling, Over the windowsill. And all I am is things I remember, And pieces I’ve glued together. And all I have is the will to keep swimming, And distractions from over-thinking. Well, we spent our spring in the safety of houses. Summer didn’t bring respite in all the chaos. Friends I haven’t seen for months, only messages and calls. And it’s just this one thing, a part of a greater fall. And what can I do that makes a difference? Is it already over? And even if it is, who won? Well, are we sinking? Or am I on the brink of being lost? In the middle of a thought. Cos, I’ve been meaning, To understand the cost, and it is hard to breathe, When the world couldn’t care less, About the mess we’re in.",

But I am just a selfish boy, I never think twice about the damage That I cause, I’m words on a wall, And I can never find the courage. I forgive you for everything, You didn’t mean to do. I should be more grateful. I owe you everything. You knew what to do, I should be more grateful. What do you care? Do you care at all? Maybe I’ll never admit to myself how small, I felt, under your stare, I remember looking through you to the wall. I know you were lost in yourself, But that ain’t no excuse.

If this is life, well, this is life, Well its boredom tears me apart. Cos everything’s done under the sun, And well, it just seems kinda dumb. I don’t know what to do, I just wanna hang with you, Til we’re out of the blue, Til the day we die. Red hair and red jumper. Walked to school in classic English weather. Quit everything I loved, Prayed to god that life would get better. Eat the berries, watch the trees swaying. Be a friend, be a neighbour, be a good faithful boy. Watch the telly, play the games in the yard, Have a cry and fake a smile, the latter’s your go-to card. See the waves as they crash upon Cornish sand, All of these things, in and out of my head, I won’t ever understand. I won't ever understand. If this is life, well, this is life, Well its boredom tears me apart. Cos everything’s done under the sun, And well, it just seems kinda dumb.

Sat alone in my maths class, Looked out the window, I almost laughed, At the nonsense in my head, Wishing to god that I was dead. And I’m always so tired, Cos I never fall asleep, As easily as I’d like to I’m plagued by a memory, Of you smiling as I’d cry, Breaking me down more every time, And I see your shadow in the doorway. Got to face the truth today, Got to play my own sad part, In this fucked up ritual’s play. I don’t need nobody’s love, I’ve got Billy with me on the rug, I’ve got shit to take care of, Really wishing for a hug. And I just need some time out, To regather my thoughts and smile, Even if it is just a disguise, I’m sure it’ll hold them safely for a while. And maybe I’ll never make my peace, Or maybe there’ll be time enough. I’m taking it day by day each week, Learning to crawl before I run. Before I run. And I just need some time out.",

But I will grieve the hope that kept me going, Through the years I grew. I know it’s not possible, It was never possible, It’ll never be possible, I know. It’s permanent death, As we bury the flesh, The hope retracts, And only you are left. But I’d rather live a harsh reality, Than believe in an impossible dream. There was always only the idea of you, But you aren’t, you just aren’t that. And I can feel the memory burning through, Rewriting the lies and defining the blood spilt as truth. I know it’s not possible, It was never possible, It’ll never be possible, I know. It’s permanent death, As we bury the flesh, The hope retracts, And only you are left. But I’d rather live a harsh reality, Than believe in an impossible dream. But part of me won’t give you up. And part of me won’t let you go. You’re woven in as a part I can’t cut out, Of my mind, but I will purify my soul. I’m purging your darkness, Whose seeds you had sown. And when I turn to look back, I’ll smile at how I’ve grown. I’ll leave you on your own. It’s where you feel at home. I leave because I know you won’t, Count the ways you did me wrong. I’m leaving to find home, It ain’t kneeling at your throne. I’ll leave you all alone, It’s where you belong.",

Cold glass, on my neck and my back. I’m riding the midnight train, Heading home once again. And I see people, the young and the old. I see all ages, and they all hold, Each other’s hands for warmth. Across from me some middle-aged men, Drunk on wine and burger king. Together for the first time in years again. Behind me, a family of four. Tired parents but the kids exhausted more, Asleep now, wildlings quieter than gentlest wind. I’m riding the midnight train, Heading home once again. And I see people, the young and the old. I see all ages, and they all hold, Each other’s hands for warmth. A loner, mysterious boy. Self-esteem all destroyed, Fretful and watching for his leave. And I see two teenage girls, Maybe nineteen years old or so, Passed out, lying down on the seats. I’m riding the midnight train, Heading home once again. And I see people, the young and the old. I see all ages, and they all hold, Each other’s hands for warmth. I'm riding the midnight train. Running on the steel road, Pavements of platforms I know. Tall grass either side of the tracks. I’m riding the midnight train, Heading home once again. And I see people, the young and the old. I see all ages, and they all hold, Each other’s hands for warmth.",

I’m in my room, staring at my screen, Tryna keep my mind off the street. They see the future as something they should keep, In a box and then push it down. I feel the pull of disillusionment, Guess it’s a commonplace feeling these days. I hear the fighting and rioting through my mobile phone, It seems the whole population is crazed. But when I walk downstairs and break my fast, I feel a kindness and warmth, the type that lasts. I wanna dive into that feeling now, Leave the arguments to the crowd. This’ll be the key, You can hold it and see, If it’s a perfect fit, Or if it’s something to leave, Behind in the wintry snowdrift. Troubles, troubles, Troubles, come back at night, Come back every morning. The grass is dead, When the don comes to the isle, And there is dread for a little while. And on the reel, there’s talk of peace at last, But my god, it vanishes so fast. I wanna cry, but my eyes are filled with stone, Cemented by all the years in the castle. Can you resign from your pessimistic post? Can we find a little hope after all? This’ll be the key, You can hold it and see, If it’s a perfect fit, Or if it’s something to leave, Behind in the wintry snowdrift. Troubles, troubles, Troubles, come back at night, Come back every morning. No, we’ll never escape, No, our shadows travel with us. No, we'll never escape, Eventually we all return to dust. No, we’ll never escape, No, we'll never escape, No, we'll never escape, Eventually we all return to dust. No, we'll never escape, No, our shadows travel with us. No, we’ll never escape, Our troubles are part of the trust, But we’ll always be brave, Yeah, we’ll always be brave. We may never escape, Eventually we’ll all return to our_ Troubles, troubles, Troubles, come back at night, Come back every morning.",

Keeping it upright, Always so uptight, And fixed on your image, Do you care for nothing more? I can see through you, Statue of glass, I can see through you. Make it all look nice, Orderly and neat, But what you do make of those, Who live and breathe? Make it all look pretty, Proper and tidy, But what of those who live and breathe? Do you find it all too messy? I bet, you can’t get your head around it, Being alive. You live in the spotlight, Talk through a cloth mic, Always so confident, In every word you speak. But I can see through you, Statue of glass, I can see through you. You seem so unreachable, Your secrets’ unspeakable, Keeping us invisible, And ever so small. But one day I’ll crush you, Statue of glass, One day will be your last. You make it all look nice… You don’t know anything. So bold that you fooled me. You can’t save anyone, Especially not yourself from yourself. You don’t get to decide for me, Or anyone else, or anyone else. You can’t save anyone, Especially not yourself. Make it all look nice, orderly and neat. Make it all look pretty, proper and tidy. I can see through you, I can see through you, Statue of glass, I can see through you. One day will be your last.",

I wish you knew, The damage that you’ve wrecked, With your inaction, But I bet you’re oblivious. You were my best friend, We had each other’s backs. I suppose you lost your focus, And your eyes relaxed. You haven’t even asked me if I’m okay. And the worst part of that, Is that ain’t like you at all. You always cared for me when nobody else did, Now I feel forgotten, And you don’t even notice. I feel forgotten, And you don’t even know.",

The doubt speaks from a seed you’ve sown What can i say? All my thoughts just get in the way Scared into belief Remedy for grief  Darkness inside i couldn’t explain Hymns learned and sung Sweetness on my tongue Sharp and bitter to the ones unclaimed I used to spit and scowl Feel its venom in me A poisonous tree Bearing apples so red and glistening  Let me sit up high Keep my peace, deny deny Burning the corners of the page til my hands got singed What do you know? The doubt speaks from a place within Ignorance and hope Aren’t the same thing, don’t you know? Found a little calm In the balance of kindness and harm Nothing’s what it seems Living in the space between the earth and the dream And all the things unseen",

Hiding our hands In the sleeves of our jumpers Love feels distant  (A dozen young ones fishing) Is there safety in numbers? Surely there must be But maybe if there isnt Then theres a sense of trust That the sun will rise in the morning  We must believe in the spring  To trust that underneath The soils of poison A seed can grow And one day it’ll be blooming",
