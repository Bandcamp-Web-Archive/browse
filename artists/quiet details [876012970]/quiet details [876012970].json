            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Brad Rose\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Brad Rose\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nVery happy to announce that next in the quiet details series is the wildly creative and prolific multi-disciplinary artist and music writer, Brad Rose.\nResponsible for a vast archive of wonderful music projects across numerous aliases, released on his own Jewel Garden and labels such as the outstanding Room40 - his work covers a huge amount of ground and is a world all to itself.\nAlongside this, he’s active in the world of visual arts, installation, design, writing - and of course one of his most well-known projects, the incredible long-running platform for experimental music and art, Foxy Digitalis, an essential resource for independent journalism.\nA Life We Once Lived is an album of deep meaning and atmospheric beauty - born out of the subconscious making sense of the maze of life, and in the process making something of incredible scope.\nThis is an album full of emotion - starting out with reflective melodics that bloom into a vast world of competitive bliss, Brad’s highly nuanced musical sensibilities take us on a trip though feelings we can all somehow relate to - his sincerity coming to the fore throughout.\nEach track turns a new corner and leads you to a unique place - the highly-refined harmonic structures matched with exquisite textural expansions. This is an artist pouring their heart and soul into their art form with spellbinding effect.\nMasterful use of synthesisers and an array of acoustic sound sources serve to create a world of singular and stunning abstraction.\nAs Brad says:\nThere are landscapes we never walk but still carry. Lives that linger just outside memory’s reach, shaping how we move through the world without ever fully revealing themselves.\nA Life We Once Lived is an album shaped by those fragments—traces of what was almost real, or perhaps only imagined. It emerged from stillness, from the quiet textures and small details that form when thought slows and sound begins to take its place. Each piece invites a kind of soft attention. There is no resolution here, no fixed meaning. Just motion, breath, and tone, held gently enough to shift and transform.\nThis is a record of almosts. Almost-places. Almost-memories. Almost-love. A Life We Once Lived gathers what’s left in the gaps: the hush between pulses, the glow that never quite fades. It leads quietly toward something larger, a dream not yet spoken aloud. This is not a story, but a signal from the margins of memory—a drift through internal weather, a gesture toward something still forming.\nFor now, it offers a space to pause. To listen more closely. To feel what remains when everything else grows quiet.\nHuge thanks to Brad - a beautiful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Brad which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nthejewelgarden.bandcamp.com\nbradrose.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Whettman Chelmets\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Whettman Chelmets\nDesign by quiet details\nAdditional Musicians:\nLucy - additional vocals “Prelude to A New Place”\nReece - screwdriver guitar “Longing for a New Place”\nDelighted to announce that next up in the quiet details series, with an incredible interpretation of the idea, is Whettman Chelmets.\nA singular artist, Whettman truly defies genre-boundaries, taking his experimental and visionary approach to music creation through many different guises.\nLargely guitar-focused and broadly covering drone/shoegaze/ambient, yet deconstructing each of those generic terms into something truly unique and purely his own. With releases on such diverse labels as Flaming Pines, Submarine Broadcasting, Girly Girl, Strategic Tape Reserve and more - each new release promises something very special and unexpected.\nA New Place is exactly that - originating from an improvised, deeply poetic song from his young daughter and extrapolated into his own improvisations, thoughts circling of yearning for new things and the nostalgia for the past - ultimately creating powerful and moving pieces that are utterly compelling.\nHighly textural, the three tracks are each complete worlds of their own - using a palette of guitars, synths, field recordings and trumpet from Whettman, his two children, Lucy and Reece guesting on vocals and screwdriver guitar respectively - we hear the full range of sonic emotion.\nSoft and gentle murmurations morph into walls of layered structures - always shifting and advancing into yet new scenes that elicit unpredictable feelings. The musicality is a match for the sound design, both so refined and precise while always feeling organic and natural - you can feel his hands making this music, the nuances come through perfectly.\nBeautiful picked guitar evolves into heavily saturated washes which turn into vast open spaces - this is a true masterclass in using every corner of dimensional space and the complete frequency spectrum to say exactly what he wants to say in this time and place.\n“There's a cyclical nature to the whole thing, and I'd like to highlight that with the words.  We humans spend most of out time longing.  It seems to be what drives us.  Not inherently a bad thing, I don't think, but at the same time, takes us away from the Now.  I think the work here focuses on that.  We long for things.  Then we find said things.  Then we continue to long.  Always on the precipice of fulfillment, but never actually there.”\nAt times light and expansive, at times dark and evanescent, Whettman Chelmets has taken the quiet details concept to a wonderful and extraordinary world - A New Place in every wonderful regard.\nHuge thanks to Whettman for everything, a complete and gorgeous addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Whettman which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nwhettmanchelmets.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "So pleased to say that up for their interpretation of quiet details we have the wonderful Daniel DeWitt, who, as The Lifted Index, has taken idea and made a beautifully peaceful and cathartic album that’s a real honour to release and a lovely addition to the series.\nA vastly experienced live performer and with a series of past releases exploring his elegant and highly-processed guitar playing, he shapes beautiful journeys that massage the body and soul - and we see that in all it’s glory with A Still Voice.\nThe album builds on his past work and takes in a more experiment and minimal direction - nothing is superfluous, every element is perfectly chosen and shaped to soothe and ease the listener into a reflective and hypnotic state of mind.\nIn part also inspired by the Endō classic, Silence, here is the intentional decision to exclude any voices or guitar melodies on this one to further punctuate the feeling of disconnection.\nThe album manages to bridge the gap between this careful and considered attention to detail and a feeling of spontaneity and organic evolution as each track unfolds.\nDeep bass tones live next to his guitar manipulations, while affected and unknown sounds fill the spaces in between.\nHazy lo-fi elements contrast with pure sounds, it’s a masterclass in restraint from someone who understands and knows exactly the headspace they’re aiming to give to the listener.\nAs always the artworks was made in collaboration with the artist, with Daniel sharing a series of gorgeous photographs he took at the time of making the album. I took these and, in a similar fashion in all qd art, created the image using mixed-media and analogue photography.\nHuge thanks to Daniel for being a part of the series, hope you enjoy his stunning album.\nHe also wrote some beautiful words to accompany the music:\n—\nUncertainty, isolation, doubt.\nConnection, understanding, peace.\nA meditation on the power of silence in a world of noise.\nIn all things, hope.\n—\ntheliftedindex.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by 36\nMastered by 36\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with 36\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nDelighted to say that next in the quiet details series is one of the most loved artists in modern ambient music, Dennis Huddleston, here as 36.\n36 (pronounced three-six) has been releasing music for over fifteen years on leading labels such as A Strangely Isolated Place and Past Inside the Present, and also on his own 3six Recordings. He’s grown a huge fanbase and is responsible for some of the most essential albums of recent times.\nA master of wide-eyed cinematic soundscapes; beautifully crafted worlds that are as harmonically rich as they are polychromatically abstract.\nA Warm Static Sphere is 36 in ultra-deep mode - vast and immersive synths mesh with opaque noise, creating waves of emotion that are all-encompassing. These give way to more delicate moments and open up to reveal fragments and minutiae buried in the depths.\nTruly horizontal music, deeply affecting and abstract, with the potential to shift your consciousness in the best possible way.\nAs Dennis says:\nA Warm Static Sphere is about finding peace through isolation.\nIt's a record doused in gentle hum/static which, when played quietly through headphones, acts like a warm enveloping sphere around the head.\nIt's like this private isolation zone between the listener and the outside world, which feels warm and safe inside.\nThe music opens up slowly, revealing its quiet details purposefully, often hidden deep within the loops.\nA masterpiece from a singular artist, and wonderful interpretation of quiet details.\nHuge thanks to 36 for being part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Dennis which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\n3six.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by anthéne\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with anthéne\nDesign by quiet details\nThis month we have a master of expansive and beautifully harmonic soundscapes giving us his stunning interpretation of quiet details, Brad Deschamps as anthéne.\nA prolific artist, with a huge discography of solo and collaborative works, as well as running the widely respected label Polar Seas.\nWe see releases on wonderful labels such as Home Normal, Hidden Vibes, PITP, Oscarson, Dronarivm, Whitelabel Recs, Archives, Ambientologist, Constellation Tatsu and many more - and collabs with qd favourites Ian Hawgood (as Rosales), Stijn Hüwels, Simon McCorry, Andrew Tasselmyer and more.\nHere we see his signature creation of vast and enveloping spaces, full of soaring waves of blissful calm and endlessly deep subsonic frequencies - his subtle guitar and synth work at times highly processed and manipulated beyond recognition, at others there to enjoy in their purest state.\nField recordings, noise and unknown sounds drift in and out of these billowing textures, expertly judged to allow the listener to float through every piece as it morphs and changes with a gentle flow.\nRefined and expert sound-design with unparalleled melodic understanding meets a complete knowledge of what makes an album work as a whole - creating worlds that soothe every corner of the mind and body, music to engulf the senses and take you somewhere else - ethereal and majestic at every turn.\nThe long-form CD version is a unique and continuous version, with additional sounds blending the tracks together seamlessly.\nIn a first for the label, I collaborated on two tracks - Brad send me the tracks which I processed here at quiet details studios, then returned results for him to use in the final versions. They were stunning to begin with and so it was real honour to be part of this wonderful album.\nThe artwork is based on two photographs Brad sent over, both of aerial landscapes. I put these through my process and we ended up far removed from the originals with an image we felt worked perfectly for the album.\nIt was real joy to master this album too, it was already mixed in the most subtle and elegant way so getting it ready to release was just a case of enhancing the beauty that was already present in abundance - something anthéne does as well as anyone I know.\nHuge thanks to anthéne, it’s an honour to have him as part of the series.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in it purest form.\nHope you enjoy x\nanthene.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "It gives me great joy to announce the next artist we have to share their quiet details interpretation is the inimitable Brock Van Wey, here as bvdub.\nWith a discography spanning nearly two decades and a musical history going back much further, he’s forged a unique and highly creative path and created a musical identity that’s completely his own.\nBrock was one of the first people I asked to be involved with quiet details and took the idea to a place I could never have imagined.\nPeople familiar with his work will recognise his unmistakable sound signature - all-encompassing washes of emotion - and here we find a delicate subtlety and exploration of the edges of sounds that makes this album such a wonderful addition to the series.\nOver the course of the six pieces on the album, bvdub’s signature melodic richness is on full display - beautiful and spine-tingling passages create huge expanses that engulf you entirely - and the range of dynamics is astonishing.\nFrom soft and peaceful to overwhelmingly powerful - this is music to take you to the deepest places - made by an enigmatic and special artist with an uncompromising vision.\nquiet details has always been about total creative freedom for the artists I love to explore what it means to them - this album is a perfect example of that, a truly wonderful piece of music that reflects Brock’s personality and stays true to the ethos of the label, it’s an honour to be sharing it with you.\nFor artwork we saw something almost blinding - yellows, red and oranges to reflect the nature of the album. It was a pleasure to make a piece to realise that.\nMade in-house with paper-making, natural dyes, mixed media, collage and analogue photography.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD is presented as a single tracks but not a continuous mix - I asked Brock before the idea was in its fully formed state and he, quite incredibly, made the album in a stream of hyper-concentration before I mentioned it.\nI wouldn’t change a single thing about it and it’s still best enjoyed in a single sitting, as the album sequencing is very carefully fashioned and makes total sense as a complete journey.\nHuge thanks to Brock for the music, being a part of the series, and becoming a friend in the process.\nbvdub.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by r beny\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with r beny\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2024 all rights reserved\nOverjoyed to say that coming next, with a jaw-dropping interpretation of the quiet details idea, is the dearly-loved Californian artist, Austin Cairns, otherwise known as r beny.\nKnown for his incredible run of releases on Dauw and other labels such as Seil Records, Longform Editions, Past Inside the Present and numerous self-releases - he captured the hearts of listeners like few others with his innate melodic sensibility, unique talent for sonic world-building, and vast technical skill.\nAustin’s huge and loyal fan-base have been looking forward to this moment and they’ve been rewarded with something truly special - ‘discerned in the fugue of streams’ is the product of all his emotion and introspection, an artist demonstrating complete affinity with his instruments and the ability to musically realise his innermost feelings with perfect clarity.\nr beny’s music has always been typified by elegant and stirring melody, coupled with exceptionally sculpted textures - here we see him expanding on what has gone before, beautifully portraying the profound nature of his creativity.\nAmaranthine clouds of pastoral bliss, inspired by the natural world and its nuances, completely immerse the listener. Each track emanating deep and soothing tranquility, expressed through expert manipulation of synthesisers, mandolin, samplers and field recordings.\nAustin displays his finely honed ability to touch our spirits with his musical sincerity - his willingness to lay his soul bare comes through so powerfully on this album - that’s the very reason there’s something about his music that so many people can relate to: honest; full of integrity; and distilled to its purest essence.\nAs he says himself:\nIn times of distress and discomfort, I often find myself seeking out the white noise chorus of water in motion. With soft fascination, one can start to take notice of the individual resonances and frequencies that make up the whole. In a state of sense- making, solace can be found amongst the distinct tones of the water cascading over moss and stone - calm can be found amongst the roar of a busy mind.\nThis album is a contemplation on slowing down and paying mind to the quiet details within the threads of noise and patterns - finding meaning and hope in bodies of water in motion, the wind blowing through the forest, the white noise of a warming world, the endless barrage of algorithms and advertising, and the cacophony of internal voices and feedback memories of my anxious brain.\nSo pleased to share it with you, a gorgeous album of breathtaking beauty. Huge thanks to Austin for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Austin which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nrbeny.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Tomoyoshi Date and Bill Seaman\nMastered by Tomoyoshi Date\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Tomoyoshi Date and Bill Seaman Design by quiet details\n© quiet details 2024 all rights reserved\nSo happy to say the next album in the quiet details series is a creation born from the collaboration of two wonderful artists, Tomoyoshi Date and Bill Seaman.\nIndividually, both artists have extensive discographies, stretching back many years\nand known for a cerebral and deeply musical approach to their work.\nTomoyoshi, solo and in collaboration (with the likes of Corey Fuller, Tatsuhisa Yamamoto, Federico Durand and Chihei Hatakeyama), with beautiful releases on labels such as LAAPS, 12k, Home Normal, Dauw, White Paddy Mountain and more.\nBill, also a consummate collaborator (with Craig Tattersall, Off The Sky, Stephen Vitiello, Tim Diagram, Stephen Spera. Michael Grigoni, Xu and more), releasing stunning albums on Room40, Longform Editions, LAAPS, oscarson, Fluid Audio, Eilean Recs, Cotton Goods and others.\nTogether they’ve made something of astounding beauty - a masterclass in electro- acoustic composition, centred around the piano and all its nuances.\nWorking by slowly passing ideas back and forth, and influenced by Bill’s work with Wei Ping Lin of the Austrian Symphony and James Chu (who both feature on the album), and progressing while Tomoyoshi was heavily involved with the incredible Ryuichi Sakamoto Micro Ambient Music project - over time the album gradually took shape.\nBuilding on an innate and natural understanding of each other, piano improvisations and sonic abstractions layer with violin and clarinet to form richly detailed soundscapes, full of micro-ambience and elegant textures.\nYou can feel how in-tune these two instinctive and highly-skilled musicians are with every passing moment - everything so carefully and precisely constructed while feeling completely natural and perfectly formed.\nAlong with piano, the micro-sounds are fundamental to this music - the fragments from the recording process, deliberately and meticulously prepared to show the listener a whole world of subtlety - delicate and arising from silence, this is a graceful and vivid experience for the senses.\nSo pleased to share it with you, a gorgeous album of breathtaking beauty.\nHuge thanks to Tomoyoshi and Bill for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Tomoyoshi and Bill which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\ntomoyoshidate.bandcamp.com\nbillseaman.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Jo Johnson\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Jo Johnson\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nSo pleased to announce that next in the quiet details series is one of the most naturally talented musicians working today, the wonderful Jo Johnson, with Escape Now\nKnown and loved across the musical spectrum for her transcendent and deeply affecting synthesiser mastery - heard on the albums for labels such a Castles in Space, 9128.live, Apartment, Bleep43, Further, Going In, Mysteries of the Deep and her own self-releases; and in her much in-demand live performances.\nPreviously also on guitar and vocals in the revolutionary punk band Huggy Bear and other projects, Jo is a true musicians’ musician and has taken all this artistry and experience to create something stunning that goes beyond all expectations.\nEscape Now is the music of an artist in brilliantly creative evolution - taking all the elements that make her so widely admired and building on them to take things to a new and mind-expanding sphere.\nAll the trademark gorgeously nuanced melody and harmony is present, deeply hypnotic and psychedelic - and now her synthesisers combine with a dazzling array of other sound sources and live instrumentation.\nRecorder, voice, bells and harp join the analogue and digital synthesis to form a living whole - a vast universe that shows Jo’s unique blend of musical skills - wonderful performance technique, exquisite taste, and the ability to orchestrate it all together in the most elegant fashion.\nEver-shifting melodic sequences come in and out of view, soaring washes of chords mix with endless organic textures - at times a huge sound-world, at others intimate and delicate - always using sonic dynamics to create a beautiful and powerfully mesmerising atmosphere.\nThe album is perfectly balanced and takes us on a totally absorbing exploration through Jo’s musical mind - it’s a brilliant piece of work that I’m honoured to share with you.\nHuge thanks to Jo - an incredible addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Jo which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artists and representing the music in its purest form.\njojohnson.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Slow Reels (Ian Hawgood and James Murray)\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Slow Reels\nDesign by quiet details\nDelighted to announce that next in the quiet details series we have two of the most well-respected artists currently in modern ambient and experimental music, Ian Hawgood and James Murray, here as Slow Reels.\nIan is one of the people behind the legendary label Home Normal, plus has a vast discography of releases under his own name and in collaborations. A masterful exponent of magnetic tape, synthesisers and electro-acoustics - Ian is loved across the musical world for his deeply thoughtful production and curation. James runs the wonderful Slowcraft label, another fantastic outlet for some of the best ambient-leaning music around. His own productions are also of the highest calibre, exploring analogue and digital techniques to breath-taking effect. Also working on film scores and more, James is an artist with many talents.\nTogether they complement each other perfectly, as shown by the previous two Slow Reels releases - Farewell Islands (Morr Music) and Sustain (Fluid Audio). This is continued in stunning fashion here, they have made something quite wonderful with their latest album, Everyday Exotic.\nBringing all their melodic and textural sensibilities, they have created an album that’s full of beautiful and deeply moving moments, always evolving yet giving you enough time to fully immerse yourself in the harmonic wonder and the vast open spaces only artists of their skill and experience can achieve.\nPiano, electro-acoustics and field recordings meet incredibly creative synth-work and granular processing, creating a peerless marriage of layers and textures - you can feel the respect and affection these artists have for each other coming through every element - some collaborations just work and this is easily one of my most loved.\nEach track moves gently and seamlessly into the next, the pacing and range of emotions are again a sign of musicians with full command of not only their tools, but also the human feeling behind what they are aiming to express.\nTo me, this is as close to sonic bliss as you can get, it’s my great honour to share it with you.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - this time originating from a picture of James’ beautiful cockatiel friend Coco, which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nAs a label we support the incredible Cancer Centre - Milton Keynes University Hospital and all their wonderful NHS staff.\nslowreels.bandcamp.com",

A tireless explorer, from intricate and deeply melodic experiments on labels such as Balmat, Frequency Domain, Miracle Pond and more, to heavy dance-floor cuts as Luke’s Anger (a mainstay in the boxes of leading DJs) and plenty of other aliases too.\nWhile less known in electronic circles, Joseph Myoushin Sanger, is equally talented. Having played Clavinet and Rhodes in numerous bands in the 90s and early 00s, as well as experimenting with his own instrument designs and tuning systems, he moved to Japan in 2006, where he took up the shakuhachi. He has been studying the “Honkyoku” (traditional/classical solo pieces associated with meditation and Zen Buddhism) with a grand master in Hiroshima for over twelve years, reached the level of master himself, and is fascinated by exploring the sonic possibilities which this seemingly simple instrument offers.\nWith Joseph on standard and long shakuhachi, and Luke on a trinity of Ciat-Lonbarde instruments (esoteric and highly creative wooden electronic instruments) and other effects, together they’ve made an album of immense depth and hypnotic beauty.\nThe combination of these two superficially disparate worlds shows, in the hands of such creative minds, the whole becomes infinitely more than the sum of its parts.\nThe soft triangle waves emanating from Luke’s Sidrax Organ meld perfectly with Joseph’s bamboo flute, intertwining in their spellbinding, always evolving microtonal themes.\nLuke’s instruments also allow the live processing of the shakuhachi, it’s tones being exquisitely suited to being reimagined electronically - down-sampled delays and loops move around the panorama while fluctuating sonic wonders come and go like whispers.\nThese textures fill the spectrum creating something that is at once organic and synthetic, at all times fundamentally human and full of fraternal emotion.\nAs they say:\nBamboo and primitive electronics\nDepict a post-technological world\nRoots entwine with broken machines\nHuge thanks to Joseph and Luke, a stunning addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Joseph and Luke which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nlukesanger.bandcamp.com",

Physical architecture translated to harmonic structures in the most breathtaking way imaginable.\nThere’s so much to admire here - from the beauty of the original recordings to the highest level of craft to turn them into something so musically engaging - a true masterpiece from one of our finest artistic minds.\nHuge thanks to Robin for being part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Robin which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nscanner.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by observatories (Ian Hawgood and Craig Tattersall)\nMastered by Ian Hawgood\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with observatories\nDesign by quiet details\nIt gives me so much joy to announce that next in quiet details series is a collaboration from two of the finest musicians of our time, Ian Hawgood and Craig Tattersall, here as observatories.\nThis one is incredibly special to me for so many reasons - both of these artists have unparalleled bodies of work across disciplines - from Ian’s huge discography of music, his work as a mastering engineer and curating his ground-breaking label, Home Normal - to Craig’s equally stunning back catalogue of music and sound art as the humble bee, under his own name and in many collabs such as The Boats, The Remote Viewer and so many more, his seminal labels Cotton Goods, Moteer and Mobeer, and his stunning visual art.\nThese two are dear friends who are endlessly generous with their time and knowledge, it’s a true honour to know them and share their music.\nIt’s no exaggeration to say I’ve played their music more than anything else in recent years - both have taught me so much and quite literally changed the way I think about and listen to music.\nThis album, frost forms, is the next evolution after their first two observatories releases - their sensitivity and nuanced approach to every aspect of sound comes together here in the most beautiful way.\nBoth experts in the use of magnetic tape, wistful fraying piano loops combine with deeply textural field recordings and so many more harmonic fragments of unknown origin - melodic phrases fade in and out of view, microscopic elements appear from the ether and there is a mesmerising quality meaning you often find yourself in a beautiful and immersive new world without knowing quite how you got there.\nHypnotising and kaleidoscopic - the sense of space and depth is so organic, and gradual shifts in timbre and structure keep you entirely transfixed for the duration, and resonate long afterwards.\nThere’s a bravery and creativeness to their music constantly surprises - delicate, reflective and expertly crafted - everything in its right place and paced to perfection.\nIt’s my great pleasure to share this with you, so much respect and admiration for both of these artists - I’m sure you’ll love it as much as I do.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - I hand-made paper sheets and dyed them with natural indigo, this was then collaged and captured using analogue photography. The resulting images were manipulated by hand and in various ways to arrive at the final artwork.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in it purest form.\nHope you enjoy x\nfolkreels.bandcamp.com\nthehumblebee.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Jordan Czamanski\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Jordan Czamanski\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nVery pleased to say that next up in the quiet details series, with a fantastic interpretation of the idea, is Jordan Czamanski, here as Jordan GCZ. So pleased to share this with you - an incredible example of where the quiet details idea can go in such talented hands.\nWell-known in the house and techno worlds for his unique left-field take on the dancefloor, plus many collaborations as Juju and Jordash (with Gal Aner), Magic Mountain High (with Gal and David Moufang (Move D)), The High On Wye Quintet (with Gal, David, Michel Baumann and Steevio), The Mullhollen Free Clinic (with Gal, David and Johan Sharp), Terrence Dixon and more.\nPlus releases on the likes of Dekmantel, Rush Hour, Further Records, Source Records, Minimal Detroit Audio, Rawax and more - the love and respect for Jordan is there for all to see.\nA master of live performance and studio improvisation, Jordan’s skill and artistry on his collection of hardware machines has few parallels. This technical proficiency is only matched by his profound musicality, fusing influences from many corners, from free jazz to classic Chicago house and Detroit techno to kosmische and beyond.\nHope isn’t a Four Letter Word is Jordan taking all these influences and experiences creating something completely himself, taking the listener into orbit and back again in a haze of texture and streams of musical consciousness.\nStarting with glassy DX7 nostalgia, his ability to compose deeply evocative melodic and harmonic structures is laid bare from the first note. Then comes the melodica and we’re in, Jordan showing his lyrical and beautifully mournful phrasing, creating something entirely hypnotising.\nFrom there and throughout the album we’re treated to a masterclass in psychedelic electronic excursions, those digital textures and melodica mix with analogue synths and Fender Rhodes - all the time the humanity of his live playing coming through so powerfully - we could be there watching him perform this, the awe of his perfectly judged jazz-infused virtuosity.\nSequenced as a proper album should be, we travel through many places - a story told through melody, otherworldly ambiences, percussive drive and so much more.\nHuge thanks to Jordan, a truly excellent addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Jordan which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\njordangcz.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Stephen James Buckley\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Stephen James Buckley\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nFor the next edition in the quiet details series we have a wonderful interpretation from the UK-based synth master craftsman, Stephen James Buckley, here as Polypores.\nAn essential element of the British electronic music scene, Polypores’ expansive albums and electric live shows have cemented him as one of the most loved and admired exponents of esoteric and endlessly original modular synthesiser sound-worlds at work today.\nWith releases on a slew of labels, including Castles in Space, Frequency Domain, Miracle Pond, Woodford Halse, Waxing Crescent Records, DIN, Aural Canyon and more - plus loads of self-releases - his unstoppable creativity knows no bounds.\nI Wish There was a Place Like That sees the signature Polypores freewheeling and completely unique approach take a deep and psychotropic leap - dense and highly detailed textures swirl and emerge from the ether, melodies grow and branch across the spectrum like fractals, always shifting and becoming something new.\nLayer upon layer of glistening harmonics mesh and unravel themselves as time edges forward, time slows and quickens, headspace shifts.\nEach track started as an extended improvisation, edited down to its essence then carefully shaped into the finished pieces. As Stephen says:\nI took the best sections of these and used them as the basis for the tracks, adding a few extra parts to develop them and add to the texture. There's a lot of repetition here - I experienced audio hallucinations during a lot of these recordings.\nVoices emerging from the music. Hopefully the listener will experience some of this too.\nUsing the trio of semi-modular synths from the visionary Make Noise, perfectly designed to live together as a self-contained system - augmented with a few choice additions - this focused setup allowed Stephen to explore their symbiosis to its fullest, an incredible example of how these tools can be used to create pieces that are both wildly experimental and deeply musical.\nThis is some of the finest synthesiser music we can have the pleasure of experiencing - kaleidoscopic, consciousness-expanding and life-affirming - huge thanks to Stephen, a beautiful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Stephen which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\npolypores.bandcamp.com",

He even appeared on the legendary John Peel Show.\n‘if all will be lost’ is Maps and Diagrams at his most nuanced - within constantly evolving landscapes we see delicate and beautifully textured miniatures fading in and out of view - it’s a huge organic world we find ourselves in, with the sense of forward motion matched by the deep feeling of serenity.\nThe level of sound design is indicative of the amount of time Tim has spent honing his craft - you feel you recognise some of the elements yet it’s hard to make out their acoustic origin - just gorgeous tones that complement each other perfectly - something is always happening, at its right time, in its right place. Metals, wood, strings, synths, field recordings - all processed to form a place all of its own.\nAt times psychedelic, others peaceful and serene - this is a wonderful album that only someone with an innate understanding and years of experience of music could create.\nIn the words of Maps and Diagrams:\nWorking with the concept of a quieter sound, and an overall theme of a world in climate survival mode - I've constructed an environment of lowercase composition for this new album, a little less-busy than my previous works, subtle and melodic themes were processed and passing moments were sketched, passed through tape and later formed into tape loops and recurring instances for an intentional shift towards an experimental tonality and a natural space within the music, this allowed me to have more fluidity, an unrestricted musical structure and reflective moments during the album making process. Each piece was [then] developed into working pieces that have gone on to form the album \"if all will be lost\".\nHuge thanks to Tim for this wonderful album and being a part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a picture Tim chose and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nFind more Maps and Diagrams along with other beautiful releases here:\nhandstitched.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "All proceeds from the album will go to the Cancer Centre - Milton Keynes University Hospital to support their work.\nCredits:\nMusic by fields we found\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nVery pleased to share with you my first publicly available interpretation of the quiet details idea as fields we found.\nAs well as running quiet details and my work as a mastering engineer, I’ve released music on beautiful labels such as Home Normal, Seil Records, Handstitched*, Ambientologist, Frequency Domain and others. Also numerous self-releases, including the new resolve / relate series of long-form deep-listening pieces, and the contrasting rhythm structures series focused on percussive music inspired by my time on dance-floors over the years.\nin your hands was made in the last few months of 2024, a year which completely changed my perception of music. As you may know from my previous writings, last February I was diagnosed with lymphoma, then went through intense treatment, which worked as well as we could have hoped, and now I’m in remission.\nMusic was a panacea in these times, long listening sessions were truly healing. I knew it was important that my own music came out of it, this album is the result.\nFundamental frequency relationships and interactions are a core part of this album - with the first couple of tracks using just intonation in precise ratios, then the latter moving into free tuning, chosen in an innate and instinctive way. Their development over time is the heart of this music.\nMade on modular synthesisers for deeply expressive tonal and textural explorations - the ability to access elemental modulation parameters and feedback paths allows for extensive interaction between the elements to create organic and complex harmonic relationships.\nPerformed live directly from the machines, recorded to tape. I love this process, it’s intuitive and entirely hands-on, human and highly focused.\nThe other essential part of the album is the use of field recordings - usually recorded myself but as I was ill, I started asking my close family to take some to use in the music. This idea grew to close friends, and continued to expand, ultimately including many family and friends - artists, musicians and non-musicians, from all over the world.\nThe only direction was record something that intuitively spoke to them - the most important thing is these wonderful people were part of the music.\nThe results were incredible and every single one is included across the album - processed, reimagined and a completely necessary part of the work.\nThis album is dedicated to all of them and everyone else that helped me though - friends, family, medical staff and beyond - all incredible and I’m deeply grateful for their support. Wouldn’t be here today without them.\nAll proceeds from the album will go to the Cancer Centre - Milton Keynes University Hospital to support their work.\nWe need to hold onto the NHS, support it however we can, and keep in the hands of the people.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from I took in our garden which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nfieldswefound.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Deadbeat\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Scott Monteith\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2026 all rights reserved\nIt gives me great joy to announce that next in the quiet details series is an artist I’ve followed for a long time and have a huge amount of love for, the irrepressible Scott Monteith, here as Deadbeat.\nSince the turn of the century, Scott has been at the forefront of the electronic music world, probably known best for his fathoms-deep dub, techno and house excursions. Releases on ~scape, Wagon Repair, his own BLKRTZ, Cynosure, Echochord, Visionquest and many others cemented him as a mainstay of the scene. There’s much more too - live performances, experiments across genres and collaborations with artists such as Paul St. Hilaire, The Orb and Lee Scratch Perry, Monolake, The Mole, Om Unit, Sa Pa and many more, have shown him to be as versatile as he is talented.\nSo it’s an honour to welcome him to quiet details, and he’s outdone himself with the next-level incredible Kansai Botanticals\nInspired during a packed tour of Japan, in his downtime Scott explored the countryside of Kyoto and the Kansai region. While there he collected the sounds and atmospheres, and this album is their musical manifestation.\nA journey of hypnosis and textural bliss - vast subs meet glittering highs, held together by lush and vivid synthetics. Scott’s huge technical skill brings all these elements together in a beautifully elegant way, creating a vibrantly chromatic world that’s mesmerising at every step.\nMade as a single piece, shared on the CD version in its original form, this is Deadbeat at his deepest and most psychedelic - truly a masterpiece from this revered artist.\nAs Scott says:\n“The autumn colors were in full bloom, and the incredible serenity and beauty of the place were beyond words. Perhaps the most breathtaking of all was visiting the former studio of Yusai Okuda, which is where a great many of the photos I've included in the folder for potential cover ideas were taken.\nIn addition to his gorgeous silk dying works, the entire place uses water in various still pools to reflect the forest around it, creating some truly Lysergic scenes. The garden behind the house is filled with a collection of ceramic sculptures of diverse sizes, which you are invited to pour water into. The water then filters through several small openings and drips into the resonant ceramic body, producing a mind-blowingly complex range of rhythms and tonalities.\nNeedless to say, we spent a good long time recording and documenting these little wonders, and those recordings, along with ones made walking in the forest adjacent, served as the initial source material and inspiration for this work.\nIf it manages to effectively convey even a portion of the spirit of that wonderful place, which so enriched our souls, I couldn't be happier.\"\nHuge thanks to Scott for this stunning addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Scott which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form - highly recommended.\nblkrtz.bandcamp.com",

Full release 14th May 2025.\nFrom his first release, the Pye Corner Audio project stamped itself as a firm favourite - with releases on Further Records, Ghost Box, Sonic Cathedral, Boomkat Editions, Lapsus and many others - the perfect meeting of cinematic synth melodics, dusky atmospherics and drum machine workouts, carved out a niche all of its own.\nLake Deep Memory is Pye Corner Audio at its most beguiling and polychromatic - inspired by a trip to Lake Atitlan in Guatemala where he played a festival in 2024, you can feel the awe of the volcanic landscape in the vastness and ethereal soundscapes across the album.\nIt’s a place that’s spiritually important to the local people, and you can feel how some of this influence made its way into the music - there’s an intangible, almost ritualistic, sensation created by the organic nature of the instrumentation - light shifts to dark, pressure gives way to weightlessness.\nThe Pye Corner Audio trademark synth-mastery is fully present, combined with field recordings he took while experiencing this most sacred of places.\nTogether, they truly create a universe of powerful and emotive vistas - a beautiful place that has the potential to elicit endless imagery in the listeners’ mind’s-eye.\nAs he says:\nI’ve always been inspired by the noises and submerged sounds that a lot of artists try to eradicate, such as noise, hums and hiss.\nThose are the quiet details that I bring to the foreground.\nFrom soaring passages of wondrous harmonic density, to highly textural and psychedelic movements - this is a completely immersive and mesmerising journey through metaphysical dreams - a stunning journey from a brilliantly talented and expressive artist.\nHuge thanks to Martin for being part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Martin (taken at Lake Atitlan) which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\npyecorneraudio.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by zakè\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with zakè\nDesign by quiet details\nTo bring in the new year, I’m so glad to have one of the of pillars of modern electronic music sharing their interpretation of quiet details, the visionary zakè.\nFounder of Past Inside the Present, one of the leading labels focusing on ambient in all its forms, and many sub-labels and connected imprints, zakè has built up an incredible community of artists and fans alike - a world of positivity and forward-thinking music loved across the board.\nHis own music is a cornerstone of this and, in many ways, represents the fundamental expression - on zakè Drone Recordings we find a dazzling array of solo and collaborative albums - the mark of an artist with a clear and pure vision, and we see this brought to bear with his stunning qd album, Lapis.\nThis is ambient music in its purest form. Layers upon layers of highly textural loops intertwine with each other over the course of each track, ever shifting and morphing as new forms emerge during the passing of time.\nzakè creates boundless and totally immersive sound-worlds, infinite expanses in which to wander - beautiful melodic and harmonic phrases drift in and out of focus, a true sense of three dimensional space underpinned by the deepest and most enveloping bass frequencies, themselves providing a perfect counterpoint to the elements undulating above.\nPlayed low, this is a guided meditation; played loud it is physical music that’s nothing less than transcendent.\nThe stunning textures are sourced from a range of instruments and recording techniques - an antique Steinway piano, vintage synths and tape decks, field recordings - all contribute to the atmospheric wonder.\nIn zakè’s own words:\nWhen I began writing these arrangements, I drew inspiration from the words of Ram Dass, who once wrote, \"The quieter you become, the more you will hear.” I wrote this quote in my journal, along with other phrases and expressions that revolved around the theme of quietude. Kept it open and next to me. These tracks revolved around crafting unhurried melodies and delicate layers that embodied the essence of silence and reflection; a quiet, hidden sanctuary. I naturally gravitated towards loop-based arrangements, as they have a unique ability to breathe and evolve. Whether engaging in passive or intentional listening, the qualities of loop-based music have the power to unveil sounds that might otherwise remain hidden, inviting the mind to become an integral part of the musical experience.\nHuge thanks to zakè for this wonderful album and being a part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a picture zakè choose and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nzakedrone.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "For the first interpretation of quiet details, it gives us so much joy to share this beautiful album from one of our favourite artists of all time, the humble bee.\nFor anyone who knows his wonderful and vast back catalogue, it's clear he embodies the idea of quiet details in a way that fits perfectly with our aesthetic.\nAs he’s been a part of the label since the very beginning, it’s so fitting this is the first release.\nStarting with subtle and detailed field recordings and frayed piano tape loops, it evolves over the course of the album, a true masterclass in delicate use of time, space and dynamics.\nMelodic richness meets fragmented loops and atmospherics in the most gorgeous way, as only the humble bee can.\nTruly an album that rewards careful listening, full of quiet details.\nMastered by Ian Hawgood, also a part of this from day one - another huge inspiration, our most trusted set of ears who’s brought out the very best in the music.\nEverything about this album encompasses what we’re about and we’re so happy to share it with you.\nAs with every release, it's accompanied by artwork handmade in-house, with the music and each artist's intuition as a guide to the palette and structure.\nMade through a combination of paper-making, natural dyes, mixed media and analogue photography – we hope each piece conveys the feeling and space of each album, directly from the artists.\nAll the proceeds from this release and certain future releases will be donated to Tonic Music for Mental Health - an amazing charity supporting musicians - 'founded upon the belief that participation in music and the arts can aid you in your recovery from mental illness'\nMore here  www.tonicmusic.co.uk\nThere is also a book available to complement the album, available via Craig’s umbrella publishing.\nContaining pictures of places many of the recordings on the album were taken, with lovely words from Craig’s collaborator Chrystal Cherniwchan - it’s wonderful way to complete the release.\numbrella-publishing.bandcamp.com\nThank you so much for your support\nquiet details\nx\nthehumblebee.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Digital half-price until 6th March x\nCredits:\nMusic by Machinefabriek\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Rutger Zuydervelt\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2026 all rights reserved\nFor the next interpretation of quiet details, I have the pleasure of welcoming a true musical experimentalist, Rutger Zuydervelt, here as Machinefabriek.\nHailing from the Netherlands, Rutger has been active as Machinefabriek for over twenty years, releasing on highly regarded labels such as Western Vinyl, Type, Important, 12K, Entr'acte, Miasmah, Consouling Sounds, Eilean and Edition Wandelweiser. This, alongside many collaborations, music for film and dance, installations and live performances, has given him a place as one of the most admired artists working today.\nKnown for his ability to bring together various strands of musical exploration - from electro-acoustic, field recording, ambience, drone, sound art and minimalism - he has created something completely unique in the quiet details series\nLijnverkenning is an album of sparse and powerful textural beauty. Machinefabriek’s innate comprehension of the potential of sound to affect us in profound and unknowable ways.\nThis is an album where the personality of the machines dictated the direction of music - carefully and deftly guided by Rutger’s intuition and musicality.\nThere’s an exquisite subtlety throughout, layers of sound implying so much and the interplay creating something incredibly moving.\nAs Rutger says:\nOf course I said yes when quiet details asked me to join their roster. I was playing Scanner’s Forces, Reactions, Deflections quite a bit at the time, and it inspired me to create my own take on the quiet details idea. I started working with cassette tapes and created a whole bunch of short, quite melodic compositions, but eventually decided they didn’t fit the label’s aesthetic, and definitely didn’t work in the long-form format that qt used for its CDs.\nSo I started anew, focusing on longer durations and moving toward a more free-form and intuitive direction. Taking time, letting my machines softly hum. In the process of creating the music, I think I found a strange form of intimacy within the sounds — as if eavesdropping on the ghosts inside the machines I was using.\nThe tracks here were mostly made by combining various layers of minimalistic improvisations with field recordings, oscillators, effect pedals, etc. I even hesitate to call these pieces “compositions,” because to me they feel more like entities that follow their own logic, rather than clearly defined and constructed songs.\nStemcassette is a different story. That track came to life after I used a short vocal sample taken from a tape I found in a second-hand memo recorder I had bought. It was filled with home recordings of rehearsals by an opera singer. A short, pitched-down snippet was used in the piece Lijnverkenning 3, but I couldn’t shake the idea of doing more with the sample. So I created the short Stemcassette from it, and felt it worked well as a mid-album “breather.”\nLijnverkenning means “line exploration.” It’s an expression I once saw marked on a public bus, presumably indicating a test of a new route. It’s a multifaceted word, with many connotations that also relate to the music. I hope listeners of this album will feel like explorers — Lijnverkenners — too.\nHuge thanks to Rutger for this stunning addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Rutger which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form - highly recommended.\nmachinefabriek.bandcamp.com",

Dub, house, techno, experimental, drum and bass and more - releases on labels such as Echochord, Electric Deluxe, Soul People Music, Silent Season, Delsin, Deep Space Media, Mule Music and many others, show how well-regarded and widely-loved his music is.\nMirage sees Brendon take this wealth of experience to create the most incredible journey of hypnotic atmospherics - we get the feeling of a composer completely at ease with themselves and their vision of electronic music.\nGrounded by the heaviest of bass-weight, each track presents a vast and seemingly endless sonic universe - gorgeous trails of musical fragments drift in every direction, floating away on crumbling echoes and near-infinite reverberant decay.\nHighly textured sonic particles come in and out of view - shifting drones, acidic undulations, synthetic waves, field recordings and broken percussion - all within a framework that harks back to the original dub masters, yet completely of today and this moment in time.\nDeft and precise studio techniques mix with an intuitive and truly hands on approach to music creation - Brendon has a unique and innate understanding of both the exact sounds needed and the exact moment to let them live - conducting this dubwise ensemble with the maximum finesse to evoke the most powerful emotions and feelings at will.\nAs he says himself:\nThe soundscapes you’re listening to were recorded over a few days in the middle of a Summer heatwave in Patterson, New York, July 2024.\nEndless hum… nature grinding slow, steady decay.\nUnmeasured rhythms syncopate… heat’s dissonance, fractured airwaves.\nTime drips, pools, melts—liquefied, slipping into cracks of unreality.\nLike vapor, slipping between what is and isn’t. The mirage hums.\nFrequencies hit—familiar but formless, just the pulse.\nAlways the pulse.\nSo pleased to share it with you, a wonderful album of breathtaking beauty.\nHuge thanks to Brendon for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Brendon which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nbrendonmoellerechologistbeatpharmacy.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Ian Boddy\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Wendy Carroll\nDesign by quiet details\nFor the next interpretation of quiet details, we have a true innovator active in the music world since the late 70s - the pioneering composer and sound artist, Ian Boddy.\nSince the early days experimenting with synths and tape machines inspired by the likes of Tangerine Dream, Ian has forged a career at the leading edge of analogue synthesis, digital sound design and beyond - recording many solo albums and running the iconic DiN label, bridging the gap between the early synth records and modern explorations.\nHe’s also a highly-accomplished live performer - playing all over the world to much acclaim.\nWith Modal Operandi, he has made a truly wonderful and deeply thoughtful interpretation - entirely in the analogue domain, with each track based on a highly- processed field recording.\nThe album is constructed in the key of C Major, with each successive track moving through the musical modes of that scale - as is apparent in track names - Ionian, Dorian and so on.\nIan is a master synthesist - each track uses a stunning array of classic and modern synth and effects - from classic Roland and EMS, to Serge and Eurorack modular, to modern Moog and Buchla to name a few. Vast and strange worlds are conjured with rich and highly textured synthesis and by using multiple reverbs and delay, again all analogue to create organic and beautifully vibrant soundscapes.\nIan is one of few technical geniuses that has the capacity to use these skills in a uniquely musical way - melodies and harmonies blend perfectly with each other as each track develops - this is an album of beauty in every respect.\nAs Ian says: “a sonic journey in seven musical modes”\nFull kit list:\nRoland system 100-M, Serge & Eurorack modulars Moog Matriarch & Voyager\nBuchla Easel Command, VCS3 & Resonant Garden French Connection & 0-coast\nTreated field recordings\nAnalogue phaser & flanger\nBBD & tape echo\nSpring reverb\nHuge thanks to Ian for this wonderful album and being a part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - we started with an original piece of art by Ian’s partner, Wendy Carroll, a hugely talented artist, which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nianboddy.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Aiko Takahashi\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Aiko Takahashi\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nVery pleased to announce that next in the quiet details series is the enigmatic builder of beautifully textured micro-sound worlds, Aiko Takahashi.\nBased in Nova Gorica, Aiko has been quietly releasing some of the most subtly alluring music for the past few years - with a string of self-releases and albums on Handstitched* and LAAPS.\nTheir highly-nuanced sound was clearly a perfect match for quiet details, music imbued with endless minutiae and new discoveries on every listen. Silence and musical ephemera meet in the most enchanting style.\nMonologue is Aiko Takahashi personified - each track is a collection of carefully curated electro-acoustic loops, collaged and processed via analogue tape and a myriad of effects, and seamlessly intertwined together.\nMade using only what was absolutely necessary - a minimal palette of felt piano, bells, sine waves and field recording - Aiko blends all the fragments together in a series of sonic tales, based on the concept of a monologue.\nAs they say:\nMonologue is an album born from the idea of creation as a monologue.\nWhen an artist creates, they speak in solitude, and only later does the work become a dialogue, resonating with the listener’s sensibilities.\nJust like a collage is made of independent elements placed together to give new life, this album was created by combining fragments of compositions made at different times.\nNow, like magic, they come together, forming a unique, living organism. Each track carries its own quiet monologue, with multiple voices telling different stories, all connected by an invisible thread.\nThe titles reflect my approach to composition, similar to creating a visual collage or sketches in a notebook. Each piece is a small world, a sonic microcosm made up of interconnected elements.\nTruly a description as finely crafted as the music it represents.\nHuge thanks to Aiko - a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Aiko which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\naikotakahashi.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Tape Loop Orchestra\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Tape Loop Orchestra Design by quiet details\nFrom Andrew:\nThanks to Alex, Alice, Beth, Craig, and Keith. Constructed by Tape Loop Orchestra at OA Studios.\nExtremely happy to say that next up in the quiet details series is the wonderful Andrew Hargreaves, here as Tape Loop Orchestra.\nAndrew is a musician of many talents, producing work across a diverse range of genres, all to wide acclaim. From industrial explorations as Beppu, to ambient and experimental work under his own name, to being a founding member of The Boats (along with Craig Tattersall then later Danny Norbury) and, in maybe his most well known solo guise, Tape Loop Orchestra. Recently he’s also had fantastic success making beautiful left-field pop with his band The Mistys.\nHe also co-ran Lacies Records, has appeared on many hugely respected labels and self-releases much of his work.\nHere, as TLO we find Andrew at his most minimal and entrancing. Using a stripped back set-up of a test tone generator, tape machines and fx, he layers sustained oscillations and allows them to weave themselves together, creating something entirely new in the process.\nCarefully chosen tunings of the sine drones allow acoustic evolution when stacked on each other, organically creating new rhythms and harmonic structures, which arise and then disappear into the textual ether as subtly as they came.\nTape and saturation play a huge part in adding a deeply three-dimensional element to the album, as the entire soundstage is engulfed with everything from the most subsonic frequencies - endlessly vast bass - to a delicate and constantly moving haze of higher harmonics, the warmest hiss and perfectly judged reverb and tape delay.\nSometimes dropping to near silence and then emerging again, there’s a reminiscence of the original masters working in the field of minimalism and drone, taking the ideas forward and letting them grow naturally.\nIt was made after his previous work “Drones in The Air”, and in this own words:\n“Both Onde Sinusoïdale Et Bande Magnétique and Drones In The Air share a similar starting point but then diverge with the different tuning methods and sonic space. Both employ long sustained notes built up in overlapping motions to reveal hidden sounds, Onde is more restrained and focuses the disintegration of the sound from the repeated copying process and is generally more quiet.”\n“The equipment used for this album was: Kikusui Model 4188 RC Oscillator, Sony TC-520CS, Sony TCS-580V, Watkins Copicat, Lexicon MPX-100 and Ableton Live.”\nThis is a stunning piece of work and fitting addition to the series - huge thanks to Andrew for letting us share it with you.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a picture of the tone generator, this was then collaged and captured using analogue photography. The resulting images were manipulated by hand and in various ways to arrive at the final artwork.\ntapelooporchestra.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Veryan\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Veryan\nDesign by quiet details\nVery happy to say that for the next edition in the quiet details series we have a wonderful interpretation from the Scotland-based artist Veryan.\nA musician of huge natural talent, her break-out album was in 2021 on the fantastic Cue Dot Records, followed by a slew of incredible releases on labels such as Werra Foxma, Mortality Tables, Dustopian Frequencies, Shady Ridge Records and more - her unique and bewitching take on electronica finding legions of fans all over the UK and beyond.\nOne Universal Breath takes the quiet details idea and creates something completely immersive, hypnotic and melodically enchanting.\nHer masterful grasp of synthesis is on full show from the first second - sparkling leads flutter over ever-undulating pads and heavy sub-weight.\nAt times perfectly judged percussion drives the tracks along - at others the sense of propulsion is achieved with rhythmic harmonic sequences, beautiful counterpoint showing a profound musicality and the skilful ability to put it to stunning use.\nThrough the precise balance of repetition and evolution, the album finds itself in a space between ambient and the deepest beat-driven explorations - reminiscent of the original chill-out rooms and bliss-state sunrises, and is in direct lineage to the classics of the genre.\nInspired by Veryan’s practice of Tai Chi and its essential role in helping her cope with tough times, as she says:\nThe inspiration for this album stems from a particular memory of sitting quietly in a park in Paris shortly after the death of my father.\nAs I continued to battle my feelings of grief and loss, I found myself drawn to a solitary lady practicing Tai Chi under one of the trees. I recall how much comfort and peace it brought me as I watched her carefully and silently perform each move with precision, focus and care and began to appreciate and accept the duality of life – the yin and yang.\nThis one's for you Dad.\nA stunning album of emotion and beauty, I’m so pleased to share it with you. Huge thanks to Veryan for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Veryan which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs a label we support the Cancer Centre - Milton Keynes University Hospital and all their wonderful NHS staff.\nveryan.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by James Bernard\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with James Bernard\nDesign by quiet details\nExtremely pleased to say that next up with their interpretation of quiet details is the wonderful James Bernard.\nSince the 90s James has been responsible for some of the most beautiful and inspirational music around, crossing genres and always having a firm footing in the most ethereal of spaces.\nStarting with the hugely influential album, Atmospherics on Rising High Records, James has continued to evolve in the thirty years he has been honing his craft.\nMany self-releases and on leading labels such as A Strangely Isolated Place and Past Inside the Present, in addition to his work as a mixing/mastering engineer, have led to James being considered one of the leading lights in modern ambient music.\nOnly Now shows exactly what James is about in this moment in time. Stunningly beautiful waves of bliss undulate across each track - layers of delicate synthesisers and electro-acoustic textures so carefully constructed.\nUsing a range of carefully chosen sound sources, from electric bass to a vintage 303, cutting-edge digital synths, granular devices and pedals - he draws out magical soundscapes full of intuition and emotion.\nAs he says:\n“most of these compositions are live improvisations using a single instrument source, performed and captured in one take incorporating sound on sound looping techniques\nthey have been recorded in different locations, including remote areas of the Los Padres National Forest in California (as you can hear in some of the field recordings)”\nYou can hear all the years of experience flooding out of the music, the patience and confidence in allowing things to bloom in their own time creates a feeling of euphoria mixed with pure serenity.\nThere’s a constant flow of meditative calm as the album drifts ever forward, this is music for contemplation and reflection - realised in the most gorgeous way by a master of his craft.\nIt’s evident from the music this is beautifully conceived, as it is from James’ words:\nI find my center in the creation of improved musical motifs\nexploring different themes, guiding them and shaping them\nlistening to them in wonder as they slowly morph, evolve\nand form into something that is enigmatic\nsomething that speaks into music, the words that can be elusive\nthis album would not have been possible without the love and support of one amazing woman, my wife cynthia\nA breath-taking album of peaceful beauty, so pleased to share it with you.\nHuge thanks to James for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from James which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\njamesbernard.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Absolutely thrilled to announce that next up for their interpretation of quiet details is the ultra-talented veteran of the music and sound design worlds, the wonderful Uwe Zahn, here as arovane.\nA brief look into his discography reveals a catalogue going back to the late 90s, always exploring the cutting edge of sound on some of the most adventurous and forward-thinking labels around.\nFrom this first outings on the legendary DIN and City Centre Offices to later on n5MD, ASIP, 12k and others - his is musical history full of incredible places to explore, always pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.\nHere we see all this experience brought to bear on this superb take on the quiet details idea.\nDeftly intricate sound manipulations and hyper-detailed digital textures somehow also breathing with a deep and enveloping warmth - each track a perfect prelude to the next in a mesmerising journey.\nUndulating drones and granular fragments melt into exquisite melody then noise shapes and beyond - this is masterclass from an artist with a crystal clear vision and all the skills to realise it.\nUsing carefully chosen tools to warp synthesised modulations, field recordings and other acoustic phenomena - a wonderfully nuanced trip through sound, never once allowing technical innovation to get in way of the true musicality at arovane’s core.\nThe long-form version continues this, fusing the album tracks together with illusionary transitions - always my preferred way to listen, this is a truly special way to experience the music.\nFor the artwork, Uwe sent me a stunning photo of inorganic evolution, a perfect partner to the synthetic nature of the album - I took this, edited, re-photographed and manipulated the results by hand, to make a final image that lives together with the sounds to make this a complete piece.\nHuge thanks to arovane, it’s an honour to have him part of the series.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in it purest form.\nMastered in-house to fully connect the artist, label and artwork.\nHope you enjoy x\narovane.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Cat Tyson Hughes\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Cat Tyson Hughes\nDesign by quiet details\nFor our final release of the year, I’m so pleased to have the wonderfully talented multi-disciplinary artist Cat Tyson Hughes sharing her gorgeous take on the quiet details concept.\nCat has a history of creating the most incredibly pure and ethereal music, with her last album on Past Inside the Present and before that her stunning debut self-released full-length. Very few artists begin with such assured and mature work and Cat has built on her innate musicality to continue making music of the highest calibre - after hearing her previous work I knew she’d be a perfect addition to the series and what she delivered far exceeded all my expectations.\nThis is an album of calm and gentle beauty - washes of Cat’s vocal soar over deep and undulating bass creating three-dimensional worlds of immense depth and space - you can feel the emotion and honesty emanating as each track unfolds.\nThis is healing music.\nDelicate melodies emerge through these clouds and waves of sonic bliss, with constant movement and endless layers overlapping to create soundscapes that have the potential to transport you to another place - the combination of vocal and synth harmonies with field recordings and electro-acoustics has resulted in an album with a character completely unique to Cat, nobody makes music quite like this, we’re very lucky to experience it.\nIn Cat’s own words this is “about childhood imagination and having the chance to live the simplest childhood dreams as an adult” - this is a deeply personal album and you can hear that resonate across every second. Roses in the Casement Window was an image that became a reality, and the album’s dream-like qualities translate this in the most lucid way.\nWe’re also very happy to have some amazing artists contribute along the way - marine eyes, zakè and Jim McDonald - all adding their touch to a track each - I also was part of a track as fields we found. marine eyes (Cynthia Bernard) and zakè need no introduction, having been responsible for some of the most stunning music of recent years; and Jim is a long time collaborator of Cat’s, both playing together in the band Fire to the Stars - so pleased to have them all on the label.\nHuge thanks to Cat for this wonderful album and being a part of the series.\nThe amount of work she put into the long-form version is staggering too, it’s a truly seamless journey that’s entirely captivating from start to finish.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a picture of a rose Cat grew herself, this was then collaged and captured using analogue photography. The resulting images were manipulated by hand and in various ways to arrive at the final artwork.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\ncattysonhughes.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Next up to give us his interpretation of quiet details, it’s the wonderfully talented and multi-disciplinary Luke Sanger.\nStalwart of the UK music scene and beyond, Luke has been making music and performing under a number of aliases for years - from deep synthesised psychedelia to jacking techno to the most spaced-out dub-influenced electronica - he’s covered a lot of ground and each time showed his originality and unsurpassed understanding of electronic music.\nHere, with ’Salt Water Motifs’, we find we him creating an otherworldly journey with off-kilter fuzzy melodics and morphing auditory illusions - this is heady and beautiful music, taking the quiet details idea and making something truly unique.\nColourful synths, some upfront and others miles away in the ether, mix with highly processed field recordings and other gorgeous sound design, making the most of every space in this nuanced trip through time and space.\nEach track is full of elements with their own quirky character and personality, there’s a huge sense of depth in this album and it flows beautifully along with each listen.\nA stunning album to warp your perception, such an honour to be sharing it with you.\nFor artwork, a pallet of purples and pinks through to shades of red and orange seemed to fit perfectly with the kaleidoscopic nature of the music.\nMade in-house with paper-making, natural dyes, mixed media, collage and analogue photography.\nHuge thanks to Luke for the music and being a part of the series.\nlukesanger.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Jolanda Moletta and Karen Vogt\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Jolanda Moletta and Karen Vogt\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nDelighted to say that up next with a beautiful and totally unique vocal interpretation of quiet details, is a collaboration by the wonderful pair of Jolanda Moletta and Karen Vogt, with Sea-swallowed Wands.\nTwo musicians with the ability to conjure transcendent sound-worlds through the use of their incredibly expressive vocal talents - together they’ve created something that takes all their individual creativity and makes a new and deeply ethereal universe.\nTheir previous release together on the excellent Longform Editions was a stunning introduction to this collaboration, Sea-swallowed Wands evolves from there with sublime effect.\nJolanda has a string of releases, self-released and on labels such as Whitelabelrecs and Ambientologist; and Karen is prolific, self-releasing and on labels such as Nite Hive, Superpang, Waxing Crescent, Wayside and Woodland and more; plus her part as co-founder and vocalist of the dream-pop band Heligoland.\nSea-Swallowed Wands is a true meeting of kindred spirits - the connection here feels so profound, and this mutual creative understanding leads to the most enchanting musical articulation.\nLayers of wordless choral beauty build up over time to create complex harmony, that’s at once both almost infinitely expansive and light as a feather.\nThe vocal orchestration is the mark of two musicians with highly-tuned intuition and elemental knowledge of symphonic structure.\nHuge washes of emotive waves flow across the album - vocal-only material from improvised seaside sessions combined with an emphasis on “the little noises, clicks, breaths, crackles and physical movements” to fully embrace their interpretation of quiet details.\nAs they say:\nVocal explorations and improvisations made while heavily under the influence of the sea and the moon\nHuge thanks to Jolanda and Karen - a very special addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Jolanda and Karen which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\njolandamoletta.bandcamp.com\nkarenvogt.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Andrew Tasselmyer\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Andrew Tasselmyer\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nVery happy to say that next in the quiet details series is the immeasurably talented and deep-thinking Philadelphia-based artist, Andrew Tasselmyer.\nOriginally from Baltimore, Andrew has forged a unique and distinct creative path, focusing on highly textural and reimagined sounds - releasing on labels such as Laaps, Seil Records, Eilean Recs, Constellation Tatsu, Home Normal, and others, and collaborations as a member of Hotel Neon, Gray Acres, and Mordançage.\nWith Signal, Andrew has crafted an album of stunning beauty and entrancing character - taking his innate musicality and, as only he can, drawing the most hypnotic shapes to completely immerse the listener.\nWonderfully dynamic, the album takes us across all manner of imagined sound-worlds - from the beginning of vast sub-bass drones and field recordings eliciting a vision of where this may have begun to take shape - to the gradual introduction of sweeping pad-like harmonies - to powerful walls of sound and beyond.\nThe album continues on, perfectly sequenced to get the most out of these rich details, ebbing and flowing with mesmeric balance.\nAs Andrew says:\nSignal came together unexpectedly over the course of 2-3 months this spring and summer, during my morning commute to work. I wasn’t chasing a finished album; I was just recording, letting sounds build, and allowing the process to unfold without overthinking…a perfect kind of process after feeling creatively drained and burned out for much of the last year. It was not so much “composing” as it was “shaping.”\nThe music blends synthetic tones, sampled fragments, and found sounds, layered into dense environments. On the surface, the tracks sound relatively simple, but underneath are countless small shifts and details.\nEverything was recorded on whatever I had with me - just laptop, tablet, or phone - with no studio setup and no separation from daily life. The result is four long pieces shaped by my routine surroundings and quiet observations: dense but open, simple but full, always shifting just beneath the surface.\nProof if ever it was needed that it’s the creativity of the artist that is the only thing that matters - Andrew has it in abundance, and has interpreted quiet details in his own inimitable way.\nHuge thanks to Andrew for being part of the series.\nAdditional textures and production on the track Signal by Dave Mantel (recording as Naal).\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Andrew which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nandrewtasselmyer.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Loula Yorke\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Loula Yorke Design by quiet details\nSo pleased to announce that next to give their interpretation of the quiet details idea is one of the most creative forces in recent times, the synthesist and sound artist, Loula Yorke.\nHaving been involved with music for many years, Loula’s star is burning brighter than ever - following a series of incredible studio albums, this year’s Volta landed to widespread critical acclaim, adored by fans of nuanced and highly musical synth work - this, coupled with her stunning live modular performances have made her one of the most loved and admired artists around.\nspeak, thou vast and venerable head sees Loula taking all this innate understanding and skilled experience to dive deeper into her psychedelic worlds of the raw electricity and vast soundscapes.\nThis is music made with a symbiotic relationship to her machines, and you can feel Loula’s energy flowing through as it moves ever forward, huge spatial plains of infinite depth guided by pure intuition. Galvanic analogue vibrations meets acidic resonant shapes, constantly moving timbres and spaces - endless drones and atmospheres underpin this voltage controlled and uniquely tactile universe.\nAdept at bringing the natural world into her work, highly processed field and environmental recordings feature prominently and provide an unknown familiarity and perfect juxtaposition to the filtered and manipulated harmonics so beautifully crafted from each electronic oscillation.\nYou can feel the human emotion guiding this music, Loula at her perceptive and spontaneous best.\nAlways thoughtful and incisive, the inspirations for the album draw on literature (Moby Dick, Wordsworth), and delves into history and connections only someone with her sensitive originality could see. In her own words:\nThis album is a plank in the hull of an imaginary ship that once set sail on a quest to uncover the meaning of it all.\nBy recombining patterns of synthesised sounds with field recordings taken from my immediate vicinity, I attempt to cause a glint in the surface of the waves.\nOnward together, Loula\nHuge thanks to Loula for everything, a complete and gorgeous addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Loula which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nloulayorke.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Kayla Painter\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Kayla Painter\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2026 all rights reserved\nTo welcome in 2026, very happy to present a wonderful new interpretation of quiet details by one of the most inventive and gifted artists working today, Kayla Painter.\nKnown as much for her stunning discography as her immersive live AV performances, Kayla has established herself as a mainstay at forward-thinking venues and festivals. She has seen huge support from leading DJs (Gilles Peterson, Steve Lamacq, Hannah Peel and many more), regular coverage in the music press (CRACK Magazine, Selector Radio, Worldwide FM, more), and all manner of other artistic bodies.\nAlso finding the the time to lecture at the University of South Wales, host radio shows, run workshops, mentor other artists and countless other endeavours - Kayla is creative force with an extraordinary energy and boundless innovation.\nSo it’s a pleasure to welcome her to the label with the incredible Tectonic Particles\nEntering with her beautifully refined combination of field recordings and tender melodics, the first tracks sets in motion an album of hypnotic and captivating minimalism.\nFrom here we move through intricately woven spaces, musical structures so deftly formed they leave us in awe of Kayla’s unique blend of innate musical understanding and vast technical skill.\nLuminous textures fill the expansive worlds, complemented by deeply emotive harmonic progressions that grow and expand - engulfing the listener in cathartic grace and balance.\nAs Kayla says:\nTectonic Particles is about small processes that make gigantic differences in the Universe.  The star burning out that explodes, creating stardust, creating us.  The drip over a hundred thousand years that forms a stalactite.\nThe seed that travels on the wind, finds a home, grows and joins the mycelium network. The drop of water that seeps in the crack which splits the cliff.\nIt's about coming from stardust, returning to dust, having a temporary stay on this rock.\nHuge thanks to Kayla for this stunning addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Kayla which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nkaylapainter.com",

            "about": "Very happy to share with you the latest interpretation in the quiet details series, this time from the enigmatic Belgian artist, ’t Geruis.\nFollowing on from a string of beautiful albums on some of the most well respected labels (LINE, LAAPS Records, Lost Tribe Sound) - this is an artist with a deep and profound outlook on the music he makes and this new album builds on his previous work in stunning fashion.\nMelodies engulfed within gaseous clouds and saturation evoke distant memories; faint and delicate textures evolve gradually over time taking the listener through a series of shifting emotions.\nThe level of sound design is truly incredible - subtle and refined, at times purposefully minimal and hypnotic, at others undulating with an undeniable forward momentum. The pacing and patience is something to behold and is the mark of an artist at the top of his game.\nInspired by the world around us, the translation of the album’s title is ‘Earth, Dust’ and it couldn’t be a more perfect reflection of the music - here are the thoughts directly from the artist:\n—\nThis album, more than previous albums, is a way of giving a tone to passion, wonder, surprise and confusion. The thing that makes your day special, the things that make a person beautiful or the things that make a place feel like home.\nThe little events that create big stories, the momentary instants that only later make the impression that flew away so quickly.\nScents, colours, images, light, darkness, sadness and love. Spring bark, concrete after rain, gravel and sand. Trains passing by at night, a sense of deep solitude, but it's alright you know.\n—\nFor the artwork, I asked ’t Geruis to send me some photographs which he’d taken and felt captured the feeling of the music - I made a collage from these and, in a similar process to all qd art by using analogue film, photographed the results, manipulated these new images by hand in various ways to arrive at the final image.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in it purest form.\nThis is also the first qd release mastered in-house, as the majority will be from now on - this further deepens the collaborative nature of the label and connection to the artists, the artwork and the overall idea behind what we do.\nHope you enjoy x\ntgeruis.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Chloe Harris\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Chloe Harris\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nDelighted to announce that next in the quiet details series is a true legend of the electronic music world, the wonderful Chloe Harris, here as Raica.\nChloe’s roots run deep - a veteran stalwart of the US and global electronic scenes - starting out working in record shops, to a wildly successful radio career, leading to establishing herself as one of the most in-demand international DJs. From there her production took-off with support from some of the biggest names in the house/techno world. DJing, live performances, production - Chloe has done it all and earned her place as one of the most loved and respected artists around.\nAlongside this she’s also the founder of the seminal Further Records and runs the truly underground store of the same name in Seattle.\nAn endless musical curiosity and open-mindedness runs through Chloe’s psyche, and an important part of this is experimental and horizontal music, explored under the alias Raica. A series of stunning albums and live shows demonstrates the breadth of her talent.\nThe Absence of Being is a truly gorgeous piece of work. It takes an artist with special sensitivity to create something so emotive and quietly powerful.\nFrom the softly undulating opening chords and gradually building synth-scapes, you’re immediately enveloped in a beautiful warmth - vivid and vast, patient and all-encompassing.\nAs the album drifts on, we find more stunning sound-worlds, each track a kaleidoscopic microcosm - perfect in themselves and together more than the sum of their parts. Minimal and expertly produced - this is ambience of the highest order.\nYou can feel it by just listening, but it’s important to know this is a deeply personal album. As Chloe says “This is basically just a love note to my mom and my son Cameron. They both left me much sooner than i would have liked. I've tried to carry on but sometimes it's difficult. So this is for them.”\nA love note to those that left too soon.\nA space for memories and transitions.\nA warm feeling that overwhelms the soul.\nLove is the answer. Love is the healing force.\nTruer words never spoken, huge thanks to Chloe - a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Chloe which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nraica.bandcamp.com\nfurtherrecords.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Plant43\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Plant43\nDesign by quiet details\nVery happy to say that next up in the quiet details series is the wonderful producer and live performer of everything from the deepest ambience to true dance-floor electro, Emile Facey, otherwise known as Plant43.\nResident of the legendary Berlin club and cultural institution, Tresor, with nearly twenty years of cutting-edge releases across genres, and untouchable international live performances of pure energy - Plant43 is one of the leaders at bringing authentic electronic music culture to our ears in the most genuine way possible.\nHe also runs and does the graphic design for his label Plant43 Recordings and is a co-founder of the Bleep43 crew who, originating from techno/electro sessions with regulars such as Surgeon and Convextion/ERP, now regularly put on some of the best and most wide-ranging deep-listening events around.\nThe Unfading Spark shows this immense and honest experience realised to stunning effect. An instant post-club classic, his innate melodic and textural understanding mixes perfectly with a sense of build and release, the album moving through its own indelible world of space-time to completely immerse the listener in its expanding beauty.\nInfluenced directly by his experiences at Tresor, with the first half of the album made as he went through the timeline of the experience playing there, here we see the impeccable marriage of widescreen synths, elastic bass and minimal syncopated percussion nodding to classic electro sound-design, with vast and polychromatic atmospheres, sparkling digital synthesis and ever-shifting distant landscapes - emotionally the quiet moments are as important as the loud and he finds the spaces between in a way that everyone who has experienced such moments can relate to.\nThe album feels like watching your favourite film, each track being a distinct scene with a story to tell, moving seamlessly from moment-to-moment, keeping you fully engaged for the duration and leaving you with an almost indescribable after-glow when it’s over. An example of thoughtful and mesmerising parts somehow creating something even more beautiful when combined so skilfully.\nIn Plant43’s own words:\nCarried on soft strings this unfading spark takes hold. Like wisps of vapour carrying spells on the wind, we move and listen, together. Voices from high above fill the air and cradled by love from afar, we keep the spark alive.\nThanks to Paul Ćinske and all of the caring staff at Tresor, Berlin. To Jo, Alex and Mike for your support and love.\nThis album is wonderful example of an artist taking the quiet details idea and making it their own - there are no limits to people that can be involved or the styles that can be incorporated, just musicians we love and their unique take on the idea.\nHuge thanks to Plant43 for everything, a fantastic and evolutionary addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Emile which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nplant43.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by Seabuckthorn\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Seabuckthorn\nDesign by quiet details\nSo pleased to announce that next to give us their interpretation of quiet details is the supremely talented multi-instrumentalist, Andy Cartwright, here as his widely-loved alias, Seabuckthorn.\nExploring all manner of experimental techniques and genres, Seabuckthorn has a string of wonderful releases, on top-tier labels such as LAAPS/IIKKI, Eilean Rec, Fluid Audio, Lost Tribe Sound and more.\nThis, combined with regular international live shows and music for film, art shows and other media, makes him stand out as one of the most intriguing and forward-thinking artists of recent years.\nWith ‘this warm, this late’ he’s taken all this experience and deep understanding of music to create something truly stunning.\nWorking with double bassist and trombonist Phil Cassel, he’s crafted an album that stands unique in the quiet details series - extended guitar techniques and incredible melodic intuition leading to twelve tracks that traverse emotions in the most beautiful way.\nThe playing is virtuosic while retaining so much soul and feeling it’s both a breathtaking and hypnotic listen - delicate tones mix with sounds that are pushed to the edge of gorgeous harmonic distortion, guitars mixed with Andy’s ukulele, banjo, clarinet and field recordings - affected and processed into what could well be felt as transcendental experience.\nPhil’s double bass and brass complements it perfectly - two musicians clearly in lock-step with each other - responding and improvising sections to become something that’s far more than the sum of its parts.\nDeep drones and distant, hard to recognise shadows appear and dissolve as we move through the album - the first time I heard this I was immediately in love - hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - this time originating from a picture Andy sent over, which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios. I dearly love this one - a wonderful juxtaposition to some of our other releases.\nA very special album in every regard - huge thanks to Seabuckthorn for everything.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nseabuckthorn.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "For the next interpretation of quiet details we have the one of the modern masters of atmospheric, enveloping soundscapes, Mark Burford as Field Lines Cartographer.\nWith a history of incredible albums and live shows, it’s an honour to present Mark’s take on the idea - a mix of beautiful synthesised textures and delicate field recordings. He has a endless talent for building deep and evolving pieces, full of melody and modulating washes of ambience that are as captivating as they are hypnotising.\nThe tracks flow perfectly into each other, taking the listening on an emotive trip through a series of wide-open spaces - truly music to close your eyes and get lost in, revealing more layers on every listen.\nMark made all the field recordings on the isle of Anglesey - these sounds are a huge part of the album and fill it with a sense being a part of that legendary place - he puts his feelings about it in the notes below, describing it far better that I could here.\nCreated on a range of analogue and digital synths and effects, combined with the location audio, Mark draws out an astonishing sound palette in his own unique way - there’s nobody quite like him and it’s such a pleasure to share this wonderful album with you.\nAs usual, a special long-form version of the album is presented on the physical edition.\nFor artwork, we chose a base of blues and green to represent the natural spaces many of the sounds originate from - the sea, skies and landscapes of Anglesey - we hope this feeling comes across and it evokes imagination of what it may have been like at that time.\nMade in-house with paper-making, natural dyes, mixed media, collage and analogue photography.\nHuge thanks Mark for the music and being a part of the series.\n--\nFrom Field Lines Cartographer:\nA sonic exploration of  place and time: past, present and future, using synthesisers and field recordings.\nEquipment used :\nLA67 Mort's Barge  - Buchla 100 Series clone small modular system\nBuchla 208C Easel Command synthesiser\nElektron Syntakt synthesiser\nFX pedals from Chase Bliss and Eventide\nField recordings from the isle of Anglesey, summer 2022, using a Tascam DR-40 portable recorder\nMany thanks to Alex for the invitation and the idea.\nSpecial thanks to the beautiful isle of Anglesey - your wonderful landscapes, people, myths and legends. I hope I captured some of your magic.\nLove to my family, friends and everyone who continues to support my music\nHeddwch a chariad\nMark\n--\nfieldlinescartographer.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Music by James Murray\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with James Murray\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2024 all rights reserved\nDelighted to say that giving us the next instalment in the quiet details series is the prolific and much-loved visionary of minimal and ambient music, James Murray.\nJames is responsible for a back catalogue of the highest quality - establishing himself as an artist that falls squarely into the ‘essential listening’ category. With releases on top labels such as Home Normal, Ultimae, Eilean Rec, Fluid Audio, Morr Music (as Slow Reels) and more, and many on his own Slowcraft, his immaculate productions have earned him a place at the top table of modern ambient music.\nHaving already graced quiet details as part of qd15 Slow Reels (with Ian Hawgood), here we find James diving deep into experimental processes, guided by his peerless intuition and refined musical sensibilities.\nThe album is as conceptually fascinating as it is aurally beautiful, as James says:\nEach track is a loose study of various structural, cultural or biochemical aspects of each plant's nature and reputation. As a collection Weeds celebrates the understated, overlooked, so-called inconvenient or arbitrarily maligned.\nHe continues:\nThis is a kind of sister album to Soundflowers (Slowcraft), though less sculpted and less formal. I've dialled back some of the intentionality and let generative methods take more of the lead compositionally and in terms of textural, granular detail.\nThis manifests itself into an album of gorgeous musicality created with vast technical skill. Each contains layer upon layer of detail, structured as a highly elegant and finely balanced whole. They unfurl in a serene and constantly shifting way, allowing the listener to be fully enveloped in these highly textured exquisite waves of sounds.\nMinimal and perfectly formed melodic phrases dance freely within extended harmonies and ever-expanding atmospheric soundscapes - James has a way of creating ambient music that is engaging and demands close listening, and at the same time meditative and powerfully hypnotic.\nThis is music that rewards many listens and reveals more each time, and can be a companion to so many states of mind - truly timeless in its conception and delivery.\nSo pleased to share it with you, a wonderful album of breathtaking beauty. Huge thanks to James for everything, a wonderful addition to the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from James which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom 6-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nAs a label we support the Cancer Centre - Milton Keynes University Hospital and all their wonderful NHS staff.\njamesmurray.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Ian Hawgood\nwith Sam Liu, Craig Tattersall, Alex Gold, and Brad Deschamps\nMastered by Ian Hawgood\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Ian Hawgood\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nTruly honoured to share with you the latest interpretation of quiet details from the wonderful and ethereally gifted, Ian Hawgood.\nIan’s done so much and been so important to modern music it’s impossible to summarise here - Home Normal is his legendary label and music under his own name, plus numerous aliases and collaborations (see the stunning qd09 and qd15 with qd favourites Craig Tattersall and James Murray for just two examples), stands out as some of the best and most thoughtful music in any genre over the past couple of decades.\nThis album could be his most personal yet. Ian is not only a musical visionary, he’s a wonderful and open human. He’s had some tough times over the past few years and on this album lays all his emotions bare and, in doing so, has created some of the most beautiful and sensitive music I’ve ever heard.\nHis masterful grasp of melody fuses with his highly refined ear for atmospheric and richly detailed soundscapes - elegance and restraint imbues the album with a feeling of deep reflection. Even if we don’t know precisely how Ian was feeling when making this, we can feel the emotion pouring out and into our very consciousness.\nElectro-acoustics, field recordings, low fidelity whispers and unknowable wisps fill this gorgeous world Ian’s created. His delicate and sophisticated playing and musical choices show us an artist at the highest level, making exactly what he needs to make to feed his soul, and in doing so, ours.\nHe also invited a few friends to contribute - Sam Liu, Craig Tattersall, Brad Deschamps and me (Alex Gold) - big thanks to them for being a part of it.\nWe’re so lucky he was able to find himself again and share this - I for one am more happy than I can say that this masterpiece exists.\nHere are some words from Ian, who puts it far better than I ever could. His honesty is beyond inspirational.\n‘well, here we are’ is an album that shouldn’t exist. I didn’t want to record, play or even see another object related to music a couple of years ago. My family and friends helped to sell off or re-home most of my studio as I went into a period of rehabilitation and counselling due to ongoing PTSD, and I just wanted to focus on regaining a sense of self.\nI can honestly say counselling and kindness saved my life. I should really dedicate this album to the NHS, the Mankind charity, my family and friends, but this is for me. This is about extreme acceptance and not allowing anyone else to define you, from whatever period of your life. So many voices stay with us from any age and can have a deeply negative impact, shattering the self. Yet the good and the bad exist and that is just that. The bad needn’t negate the good. It all just exists.\n‘well, here we are’ is not an album of conclusion and recovery. It is that of arrival. We arrive at points in our life where the trauma of the past and fear of the future have less of a hold over us the more we invest in ourselves and those who love us. There’s great peace and joy in that, and that’s where ‘well, here we are’ is for me. It is where I am at right now. It is of light seeping through the porous darkness and focusing on that, of recognising the good and the bad equally but being present within that. It is of acceptance that life is hard but that we can find a way.\nThank you\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Ian which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, representing the music in its purest form.\nfolkreels.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Credits:\nMusic by Shawn Rudiman\nMastered by Alex at quiet details studios\nArtwork by quiet details in collaboration with Shawn Rudiman\nDesign by quiet details\n© quiet details 2025 all rights reserved\nFor the final release of the year, very happy to welcome one of the most tenacious and sincere artists making electronic music over the past few decades, a true believer, Shawn Rudiman.\nCommitment is a word that suits Shawn perfectly - playing live and recording since the late 80s, a permanent fixture of the US electronic music underground, never wavering from his singular vision for the dance-floor and beyond.\nFrom early industrial work to a slew of techno/electro EPs and albums on labels such as Daniel Bell’s 7th City, X-Trax, 11th Hour Recordings, ART, Detroit Techno Militia, Tresor, Pittsburgh Tracks, self-release and many more, Shawn’s proved himself as one of the most important voices we have.\nIncluded in these releases were many stylistic diversions, including more ambient terrain - showing Shawn to be a tireless explorer and student of music in all its forms.\nFrom the Synthdrome, his studio filled to the brim with electronic instruments from across the eras, he’s crafted an incredible interpretation of quiet details, totally unique and a true reflection of who he is as an artist.\nStarting with highly textural and layered slow-mo machine rhythms, pure down-tempo funk full of syncopated synthetic melody, we’re straight into Shawn’s trademark craft from the beginning.\nFrom there we’re locked into an album in its truest sense, a finely constructed architectural marvel - from vast deep-space ambience to propulsive swung sequences - from ethereal atmospherics to euphonic harmonies - from intricate sound shapes to hypnotic acid.\nAs Shawn says:\n\"The way I look at albums of any sort is that they're a soundtrack - ambient especially. Also of the opinion ambient can have rhythm and beats. They just have to be appropriate and work well. For me it’s feel. It has to feel right. Has to grip you and hold you. No matter what.\nI try and catch the feelings and ideas that come to me and thru me. No matter what they are or their form/genre. Their feelings and impacts are what remains for me, in order to shape the sound and emotions they carry. I simply try and transduce them for others to experience, and put the emotional words into coherent artistic sentences.\nThank you to quiet details for the chance to present this work! Thank you to Victor Labonte for the assistance and tech/computer work on \"last message sent\" - track wouldn't be without your help! Thanks to Nick for the connection to make this happen.\nAs always, thanks to my wife for understanding my obsession with music and electronics.\nThank you all for supporting and listening. Enjoy.\"\nHuge thanks to Shawn for being part of the series.\nThe artwork was made as always influenced by the music and idea behind the album - originating from a photo from Shawn which was then captured with analogue photography and processed here at quiet details studios.\nAs usual, the album is presented on the physical edition, a custom six-panel digipack with a separate fine art print too.\nThe CD also has a special long-form continuous mix of the album, created by the artist and representing the music in its purest form.\nshawnrudimanmusic.bandcamp.com",
