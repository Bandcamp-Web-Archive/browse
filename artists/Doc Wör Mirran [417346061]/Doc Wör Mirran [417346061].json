A benefit to raise money for the John Peel Heart Foundation, this concert found Joseph B. Raimond, Ralf Lexis and Adrian Gormley together on a stage for the first time. Adrian even flew in from California for this one show. This is the fifth installment in our series of free CDs, and considered by many to be one of the finest DWM albums ever recorded.",

            "about": "Many years ago, DWM recorded their versions of three Beatle's tracks for a 7\" boxset tribute to the Beatles which unfortunately was never released. Many years later, DWM was given the opportunity to license an early Beatles track, which resulted in our \"Cry For A Shadow\" split 7\" vinyl single with the Beatles, which was released in 2017. The other two tracks, \"Free As A Bird\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" are now available as well on this two song mini-CD. Features cover photography by Cedric Raimond of his father Joseph B. Raimond as he crosses, what else, Abbey Road. More photoediting as well by our long-time DWM cohort Ralf Lexis, who, besides Joseph, is also prominently featured on the musical part of this release.",

            "about": "This is probably the most frustrating of all DWM releases. Originally, this one was set to be released on Rigid Records in the USA. Covers were even printed for it and sent to the USA, and so all was set. Unfortunately, the label never pressed the record (even though they claimed that they had). Luckily, the fine folks at Frownland liked these songs, and although they were recorded years ago, still decided to release it. Cover art is the same, although the booklet is now a few pages shorter (8). The Rigid covers were black on tan paper and red and blue mixed on white paper, and have all been destroyed except for a few in our DWM archives. The new cover is black on grey paper, booklet black on white paper. Labels are black printing on white (check out the B-side design, the label's graphic guy scanned his own penis for it!!). Released December 1994, 1000 pressed, 200 of which are on white vinyl. Includes performances by J. Raimond, B. Worrick, J. Biafra, Denise and Deanne Kusiak, R. Lexis, P. Schuster, J. Eberly and A. Shain. German pressing.",

            "about": "What the hell? Recorded live in 1972 in New York at Madison Square Gardens? Frank Zappa, George Harrison and Charles Bukowski among the guest stars? And produced by George Martin to boot? Did DWM really write a song called \"Good Loving Gone Bad\" and play \"Freebird\" as an encore? Alternative facts! If Donald Trump can change reality as he likes, so can we! But facts are facts, and we can't change the fact that this was recorded live on October 14th, 2017 at the Provino Club in Augsburg, Germany. Made to look like one of those classic bootleg LPs from the 1970s, complete with unprinted labels and photo-copied cover, about the only thing on the cover that is not an alternative fact are the pictures of DWM on the back in their hippy period. One hundred and four pressed, with a limited numbered edition of 23 copies including grass from Madison Square Gardens. Oops, sorry, no, it's just normal plastic grass. It's just so easy to fall back into alternative facts!\nRemember, LOVE MUSIC, HATE FASCISM!",

            "about": "A few years after the \"Shroud\" project was released, DWM put out this elaborate box set to celebrate the 250th release on MT. Inside, it contains several prints by Joseph B. Raimond and his daughter Jeandra, a tar painting by Peter Schuster, an LP and a Cassette, and a ceramic plaque by Joseph B. Raimond engraved with the buyers name and copy number, all contained inside a hand painted (both inside and out!) box. Limited to 20 copies, the box also contains the name and copy number of each buyer ( it was not pressed until all copies had been reserved and paid for!). Due to the fragile packaging, the entire box is then wrapped in a spray- painted sheet of clear protective plastic. The vinyl LP itself is one-sided (the label is a spray painted red cassette label with black printing that matches the labels on the tape) black vinyl, the other side of which is spray painted and has a large paper sticker of weird artwork.The cassette is black plastic, without box. Musically, it contains live recordings of very good quality from our former Nürnberg area practice room, featuring Joseph B. Raimond, Peter Schuster, Adrien Alecu and Kid G. Totally live recorded in our rehearsal room, there are no overdubs on these recordings. It cost DM 200.- at the time, but due to the fact that each copy is personalized, we can't imagine anyone parting with one. It took a good half year to compete all 20 copies!",

Originally planned as part of that series, it ended up with a dynamic of its own, so we decided to make a small single with the tracks. Playable at any spead, it features several old recordings taken from mostly cassette releases, plus newly recorded material, all mixed together into a stew of weirdness. Limited edition of 23 copies on clear vinyl with cassette labels as labels. Featuring Adrian Gormley, Joseph B.

            "about": "In an effort to out-do everyone in the field of cool packaging, the two thirty minutes tapes in this set are sandwiched between two pieces of wood, and all held together with two nuts and bolts that go through the wood and through the wheels of the tapes. Two inserts are glued into the insides of the wood pieces, and the artwork on the outside is a piece of photo-etched metal, some in red, some in blue. Musically, a very industrial affair, and a limited edition of 100 copies.",

When he tweeted his infamous \"covfefe\" tweet, DWM felt so inspired, that those seven, simple letters evolved into the new, eleven track DWM studio album from 2017, featuring the new studio versions of many of the tracks that were featured at their concerts and the resulting live albums.",

Known for his distaste for full time employment, this found expression in much of the DWM work of the time. Judging from the cover, it is also no coincidence that the main CRD offices were housed in a former prison cell. How appropriate! One of the first recordings stemming from the new Two Car Garage Studios in Nuernberg, limited edition of 120 copies.",

The Beatles' side is of course not a new track, but one of the earliest recordings the Beatles ever made, and Klaus Voormann, who designed the original Beatles \"Revolver\" album cover, also allowed DWM to license his artwork for the Beatles' side of the cover of our single. On side two, the DWM cover of \"Cry For A Shadow\"comes from one of three Beatles covers that DWM originally recorded in the late 1990s, for a Beatles tribute that was never released (the other two tracks \"Free As A Bird\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" have since been released on the DWM mini CD \"Abbey Toad\"). In total, 300 records were pressed on black vinyl as welll as 197 on gold vinyl.\nPlease note: as DWM does not claim to own the rights to any music other than their own, we can only offer the DWM track of this release for downloading and streaming. If you jwould like the Beatles track, you have to buy the single.",

            "about": "This one was our second ever vinyl release, and is much more industrial than the first, which was released exactly one year earlier. Six tracks, each ending in a locked groove. This was released in various editions, the first of which was 200 copies in April 1988 that featured our standard booklet stapled into the cover, this time with 12 pages and many of the multicolored printed artworks glued into the booklet. The cover of this first edition was designed and handprinted by Joseph B. Raimond including glow in the dark ink. All other editions did not include the booklet. The second edition of 10 copies was released in September 1988 with a clear plastic cover. The third edition was of 100 copies with a hand painted, folded cover, copied onto an official US Army \"disposition form\", and came in October 1988. Edition four was with a poster cover spray painted and then folded to a 7\" cover size, and came in May of 1989 with an edition of 54 copies. Edition five came in April 1990 and featured the record and copy of the cover inserted into a US Army courier envelope. Editions six, seven and eight all came out in November 1993. Edition six was of 50 copies, all of which went to Forced Exposure in the USA. Their logo is printed on the computer generated cover. Edition seven also is computer generated, but not for Forced Exposure, with a different design, and was 70 copies. The final edition eight was of 25 copies and came in a folded version of the glow and the dark cover but without the booklet. 559 pressed in total on black vinyl, each with the edition number written on the label by hand.",

This is the first time DWM has recorded extensively with a drummer and the result is a totally new sounding DWM instrumental recording that is much more dynamic than most previous recordings. Ten tracks in all, they still feature that DWM garage rock sound that defies all catagorization, which runs the whole spectrum from spaced out psychedelic rock to loud industrial influenced noise rock.",

            "about": "Twenty-five years to the day after the release of the very first DWM release (see early cassettes), DWM releases this re-mixed and partially re-recorded version of their classic cassette-only release. Part one of Historical Obscurity, a series of releases that will feature new versions of old, out of print tracks. Originally recorded in San Francisco when DWM was based there, many of the very experimental tracks were assignments for an electronic music class that Joseph B. Raimond was taking at the time. Cover includes photography by Jeandra Raimond of a bronze sculpture by Joseph B. Raimond that was inspired by the original cover art. Besides the original line-up of Joseph B. Raimond, Bernard Worrick, Rich Ferguson and Frank Abendroth, it also features on the new recordings input by Ralf Lexis, Peter Schuster and Jeandra Raimond. The original cover art of the cassette is also included in the cover.",

            "about": "The very first ever DWM release, this sixty minute cassette was released together with the first Masking Tapes compilation tape \"Numb Tongues, No Taste\" on December 20th, 1984. This tape was a collection of pieces recorded in the San Francisco State University electronic music class, and after the semester ended, there were enough good pieces to fill a tape. The recording quality is not the best anymore, but it is still a very worthwhile, and for DWM, historic release. This tape was the result of a very difficult learning process, as none of the members had any real recording skills or experience, and found the instructor in the class to be inept at best in demonstrating the equipment, so most of the work was done on a very trial and error method. This tape features several pieces using a classic Buchla rack mounted pioneer synthesizer, the \"composition\" resulting from the combination of cables connecting the various modules. What results is randomly generated sounds, which would play forever and always be different, until someone turned the system off. Some of the pieces on this tape were actually used as background music for the local University television station during the night. Most of the pieces by Joseph B. Raimond exclusively, Rich Ferguson played on a few tracks, and sounds recorded years earlier by Frank Abendroth (see the DWM \"Early Stuff\" release) appear as well. An extra sheet to be included with each tape was prepared and printed by Rich Ferguson, that included written material by him as well as Bernard H. Worrick. This tape was later remixed and partially re-recorded and released on MissmanagemenT as a CD on the 25th anniversary of the release of this tape.",

Including historic photos of the original Bergmann house on Am Elfegrund street in Darmstadt, the center of the world in the late 1970s.",

Four songs, released on red splatter colored vinyl, this record also featured a 16 page booklet incorporated into the cover, a feature that virtually all early DWM vinyl singles were to have. Stylistically, this can best be described as \"aggressive industrial punk\". 500 pressed.",

A novelty record of sorts, vinyl etchings by Joseph B. Raimond are featured between several of the nine tracks making up this album, which means that you have to pick up the needle a lot to listen to all nine tracks. A bit pop, a bit romantic jazz, and lots of weirdness, this is a classic DWM release. Edition of 561 copies.",

            "about": "Some bands tour to support a new release. Not DWM! They exhibit paintings for a new release! This CD was released to coincide with a showing of paintings and drawings from the \"Plop Art\" series of works by Joseph B. Raimond, shown at Galerie Nord in Nuernberg, from Febraury 26th through March 24th, 1994. All cover art from the CD comes from this series of works and were part of the exhibition. Full color cover throughout. A much better mix of one song from the Garage Pretensions project is again released here, and features Axel Ruhland and Mike Pelzo of M. Walking On The Water. Other outstanding performances by John Griffith as well as Antje Haensel from the Merlons. One track, recorded with John Mervin in 1983 in San Francisco, and released on the very first ever MT release \"Numb Tongue, No Taste\" is rereleased here with a new vocal track. More song and vocal oriented than many DWM releases, which usually tend to be more experimental, instrumental affairs, this was the first major release recorded and released after the departure of Bernard H. Worrick. Other performances included Joseph B. Raimond, Ralf Lexis, Peter Schuster, Andropovski, Theodor T. ThrongoMob, Frank Abendroth, Oliver Van Essenberg, Peter Kern and Michael Shulz-Pernice. A limited edition of 50 copies was produced that included a second non playable, hand painted and numbered CD. An interesting footnote: several copies were misspressed by the manufacturer with Reggae music instead!",

            "about": "A milestone for DWM, this EP was their first ever DWM CD release, and also the first release ever to come out on two different formats. In keeping with their tradition of featuring famous friends, this release includes the talents of two members of M. Walking On The Water, Markus Jansen and Axel Ruhland, as well as the recorded debut of the two SubPop Records owners Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman (reading a poem for Blake!). Also, on the vinyl version is a cartoon drawing of \"Fat Freddy\" by none other than Gilbert Shelton and Rip Off Press! Andy Martin of the Apostles/Unit drew the back comic. Both formats include a 12 page booklet. The CD has a blue and black cover, the vinyl a light green and black cover and is pressed on yellow and blue striped vinyl.

Similar to Do Quermin Ran, this recording, also from 2011, sees DWM in an almost classical band format. Recorded \"live\" in the practice room, the various tracks were then augmented with various overdubs in the studio, and include such gems as \"Mail Ankolja\", which almost falls apart, the driving organ based \"Ham And Organs\", and the beautiful \"Adriana Paintress\", one of the finest and moving recordings ever by DWM.",

            "about": "The first in the series, Gravy Slam can sort of be considered the sister album to our Doctors Fighting Wars For Man double LP. Whereas “Doctors” was an album with lyrics and singing, this album is strictly instrumental. As Marc Behrens so exasperatingly put it, “its pop music!”. Some of the standout tracks include “Honky Tonk Tits”, the grooved out “Go On Out Number 52, You’re Next”, “Chaka Can’t” and “There I Go, Istanbul”. Great open up, gatefold cover in glorious 3-D full color. In fact, a limited, numbered edition version of 50 copies was also released that included official DWM 3-D glasses! Recorded fall 1990 through February 1991 at both Two Car Garage Studios, Nürnberg, and Lexisound, Feucht. 500 made.",

Less experimental than other recent releases and more structure oriented, some standouts include the instrumental version of \"The Matala Tribe / Supraluminal\" as well as a DWM interpetration of country music in \"Billy Bob's Country Riff\" and the title track \"Hatriots\".",

PLEASE NOTE: on the CD version the entire piece is one track, but due to the length of the track and the 600 MB limit for uploading tracks, we have turned the recording here on Bandcamp into two tracks.

            "about": "Released on February 29th, 2024, a leap year, this album is also sort of a leap for DWM (bad pun, we know!), for it is their first album recorded using computer software instead of their trusted digital 8-track recorder. Although recording software can be a useful tool, DWM will continue to mainly use their 8-track, mostly due to the ease of mixing and mastering with knobs and sliders. Musically, this one is a very abstract release, with lots of found sounds swirling in and out of the mix, the recording running through various effects to give it a very atmospheric feeling. A particular highlight is the musical return of Michael Asch, who after more than two decades has resumed working with DWM. Also features Joseph B. Raimond, Michael Wurzer, Steran Schweiger, Adrian Gormley, Ralf Lexis, Joi as well as mystery guest L'Angelo Mysteriosox3. All cover art by Adrian Gormley and Joseph B. Raimond, which was also featured in the corresponding \"Pointless\" exhibition opened March 3rd, 2024 at the cultural center of the University Hospital at the Leipzig University.",

Worrick and Joseph B. Raimond came up with this iconic title, which has sort of become a symbol for DWM's love/hate relationship with all things jazz ever since. One long piece here stretched over two sides of a thirty minute cassette, it starts off with a very basic guitar/bass/drums riff and slowly mutates into a raging industrial storm by the end of the first side. Side two continues with this mayhem before gradually coming back to the simple guitar riff.",

            "about": "Forget \"Bastard Pop\"! Long live \"Bastard Plop\". The idea is to have each DWM member play and record their instrument on songs that they have never heard before. They also do not know what the other DWM members have recorded. Once everyone has recorded their part, the original song is erased, and the individual DWM tracks then mixed. The result is a fascinating, disjointed and odd sounding group of songs where one can still hear the arrangements and the song structure, and sometimes even the original melody, but in a very obtuse and unexpected way. In this case, our victim was Vico Torriani and his \"Las Pastorella\" collection of German \"Schlager\" songs. Could this be the start of a whole new way of composing and creating music? How is that for a threat!",

            "about": "Both the \"Taltos\" series of paintings as well as the \"Lasher\" recordings were inspired by the Anne Rice trilogy of books \"The Witching Hour\", \"Lasher\" and \"Taltos\", commonly known as the “witches trilogy”. A body of work was created that, although independent in itself, was inspired by the books. As with many DWM ideas, this project spans several mediums (several audio tracks, a series of paintings, and a poem), produced over a period of a few years, that should be regarded as a whole in itself.\nMusically, these tracks remain some of the most romantic and dark that DWM has ever produced, almost as if \"romantic industrial\" was a genre in itself. This CD remains one of the highlights in DWM's long discography.\nDWM sent a copy of the CD to Anne Rice, but her lawyer sent it back unopened, with an official statement that it was not listened to! It seems they think someone would use the opportunity to sue them if they ever made a film of the books, and the music would be too similar.",

            "about": "The songs on this CD started out as computer compositions on an ancient Commodore computer owned by DWM's Andropovski, and although very old fashioned by today's very high standard of computer technology, the limited technology gives the tracks a very special kind of charm. When finished, the tracks were then transferred to a normal analog deck, where further analog recordings and instruments were added. Similarly, the accompanying series of pictures started out as normal paintings, which were then scanned into a computer and further changed. The recording took many years to complete, with the final mixing taking place at Two Car Garage Studios in Novermber 1997. This recording features Joseph B. Raimond, Peter Schuster, Jeandra Raimond, Ralf Lexis, Andropovski, Manfred Schumann, John Eberly, Laurent Gabiot, Dad Raimond, Theodor T. ThrongoMob, Kid G., as well as one of the very last performances ever of Bernard H. Worrick. Full color cover and tray from the painting series, which were painted by Joseph B. Raimond, Stefan Schmidt and Jeandra Raimond. This release was a kind of sampler of labels interested in DWM, and was put out by the labels involved together.",

This one is much more ambient in sound, and is almost strictly synthesizer music. Music by Joseph B. Raimond with a little help by Peter Schuster and Laurent Gabiot. The inside booklet is 8 pages of art from the “Celebrate The Line” series of drawings by Joseph B. Raimond drawn in Prague in November 1994. For each drawing is a corresponding poem, also by Joseph B. Raimond, denouncing the ills of our modern society in general, and the indie music scene in particular. Front cover is orange and black on grey paper. Black vinyl, 500 pressed,",

Joseph loved the photos, and asked Tom if he could use some of them on a DWM release. Two weeks after sending Joseph the photos, Tom took his own life. In pain from chronic arthritis and homeless, living now in his car, Tom took his life in the parking lot of a VA hospital that refused to treat him. This recording is for Tom.",

            "about": "Coined by Andy Martin of the Apostles to describe Doc Wör Mirran’s unique approach to creating music, this is not punk in sound, but in spirit. Recorded between 2016 and 2020, for this mammoth project DWM tried something different. Instead of recording enough tracks for a full-length CD, the idea was to simply record a large amount of material, and then choose the best tracks for a vinyl album, maybe even a double LP. Once everything was recorded and mixed, copies of all the tracks were given to the various DWM members to listen to and list favourites. The problem was, with few exceptions, there ended up no real consensus of what were the strongest tracks. So instead, the tracks were arranged into groups of 20 minutes, roughly the length of an LP side. Once all were mastered, we ended up with 12 separate “sides”. Released at first as mini-CDs (vinyl is planned!) on Mirran Threat, each release will feature a different cover artist. Further releases with tracks from these sessions include the \"Hiraeth\" and \"Ancient Future\" picture discs, the double C-60 cassette set \"Mischen Impossible\" of remixed versions and unreleased tracks, as well as Stefan Schweiger's remixed compilation \"Second Try\".",

            "about": "Coined by Andy Martin of the Apostles to describe Doc Wör Mirran’s unique approach to creating music, this is not punk in sound, but in spirit. Recorded between 2016 and 2020, for this mammoth project DWM tried something different. Instead of recording enough tracks for a full-length CD, the idea was to simply record a large amount of material, and then choose the best tracks for a vinyl album, maybe even a double LP. Once everything was recorded and mixed, copies of all the tracks were given to the various DWM members to listen to and list favourites. The problem was, with few exceptions, there ended up no real consensus of what were the strongest tracks. So instead, the tracks were arranged into groups of 20 minutes, roughly the length of an LP side. Once all were mastered, we ended up with 12 separate “sides”. Released at first as mini-CDs (vinyl is planned!) on Mirran Threat, each release will feature a different cover artist. Further releases with tracks from these sessions include the \"Hiraeth\" and \"Ancient Future\" picture discs, the double C-60 cassette set \"Mischen Impossible\" of remixed versions and unreleased tracks, as well as Stefan Schweiger's remixed compilation \"Second Try\".",

            "about": "Coined by Andy Martin of the Apostles to describe Doc Wör Mirran’s unique approach to creating music, this is not punk in sound, but in spirit. Recorded between 2016 and 2020, for this mammoth project DWM tried something different. Instead of recording enough tracks for a full-length CD, the idea was to simply record a large amount of material, and then choose the best tracks for a vinyl album, maybe even a double LP. Once everything was recorded and mixed, copies of all the tracks were given to the various DWM members to listen to and list favourites. The problem was, with few exceptions, there ended up no real consensus of what were the strongest tracks. So instead, the tracks were arranged into groups of 20 minutes, roughly the length of an LP side. Once all were mastered, we ended up with 12 separate “sides”. Released at first as mini-CDs (vinyl is planned!) on Mirran Threat, each release will feature a different cover artist. Further releases with tracks from these sessions include the \"Hiraeth\" and \"Ancient Future\" picture discs, the double C-60 cassette set \"Mischen Impossible\" of remixed versions and unreleased tracks, as well as Stefan Schweiger's remixed compilation \"Second Try\".",

Recorded between 2016 and 2020, for this mammoth project DWM tried something different. Instead of recording enough tracks for a full-length CD, the idea was to simply record a large amount of material, and then choose the best tracks for a vinyl album, maybe even a double LP. Once everything was recorded and mixed, copies of all the tracks were given to the various DWM members to listen to and list favourites. The problem was, with few exceptions, there ended up no real consensus of what were the strongest tracks. So instead, the tracks were arranged into groups of 20 minutes, roughly the length of an LP side. Once all were mastered, we ended up with 12 separate “sides”. Released at first as mini-CDs (vinyl is planned!) on Mirran Threat, each release will feature a different cover artist.

            "about": "There is a story behind the cover art to the ninth installment of the Progressive Punk series. Several years ago, both Stefan and Joseph played in the punk band \"The Pisstons\", and one of their concerts was at the Indra bar in Hamburg on the street Große Freiheit in the infamous red-light district of St. Pauli, and where the Beatles played their first ever concert in Germany. As a Beatles fan, this was particularly important for Joseph, to actually stand on the same stage where the Beatles once stood many decades earlier. Later, while organizing the release of the split Bealtes/Doc Wör Mirran \"Cry For A Shadow\" 7\" single, DWM was in contact with Klaus Voormann, famed graphic artist who designed the cover to the Beatles landmark album \"Revolver\" and who himself is an accomplished studio musician, playing on dozens of albums including many solo albums of the ex-Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison and a few Ringo albums as well. While organizing the cover with Klaus, Joseph noticed that he had also created \"Boulevard Of Broken Strings\", a drawing of the street Große Freiheit in Hamburg. In fact, one can almost see the Indra bar about a block behind the figure in the drawing. Joseph knew that he just had to ask Klaus if DWM could use this cover for one of the releases in their Progressive Punk series.",

Eric was the leader of Der Durstige Mann, one of DWMs biggest influences, and it is an honor having him appear on this record. Some of the first batch of covers were lost, so the first set is crimson and black on white paper, with a 12 page booklet (b & w), the second set black and blue on white, no booklet. 600 pressed, in the USA.

            "about": "One of our finest recordings, and also unfortunately, one of our most overlooked. Finally released in February 2015, quickly on our Hand-made label as a CDr release just to get it out, this one originally was planned as a vinyl LP. Often refered to as our \"Pink Floydish\" recording, this does in fact have many elements that might justify such a description. Leaning heavily on the progressive rock label, here we see DWM recording atmospheric rock pieces with blistering guitar solos. One of DWM's most requested gems, these tracks, many of them already a quarter century old, finally see the light of day with this release. Features some of the best vocal performances by DWM founder Bernard Worrick, and hints at the potential he could have had if he had stayed in Germany and continued to record and perform. Also features guitar work by the late Michael Schulz-Pernice, guitarist for Prime Sinister at the time, and violin work by Joolie of Current 93.",

            "about": "For the most part, Retch is a collection of instrumental DWM outakes and spare tracks. They were thrown onto the master without much thought to order or flow, and many were perhaps even considered unfinished at the time they were recorded. You’ll hear that wonderful invention of analog recording techniques, tape hiss, on some of the tracks, betraying the fact that they were recorded on our old analog 8 track, which died years ago. Take it or leave it, Retch is what it is. Most of the last half of tracks were originally slated to become part of our aborted DWM/Motorpsycho collaboration project “Music From The Back Seat Of My Fjord” (thanks Jeannette for the great title). Other tracks were slated to become part of a new DWM studio album that just sort of lost steam. By the way, the spoken word intro to “Trekno”, recorded a few hours before he actually left, was the last thing Bernard H. Worrick recorded before moving to Florida and into Wal-mart oblivion. Recorded for the most part in Fuerth, Germany, some individual tracks were also recorded in Adine, Italy and Berkeley, California.",

            "about": "In the summer of 2016 DWM got together a three-piece instrumental lineup to play a special show on the 23rd of July at the K15 in Augsburg, Germany. For this show, Alex Kammerer played guitar, Stefan Schweiger was on drums and Theramine, and Joseph B. Raimond played his monster guitar and bass double neck with effects and loops. Very \"stoner rock\" oriented, this guitar dominated set consisted of six well rehearsed tracks that are to date the most guitar oriented work DWM has ever released, mixed together with very experimental, almost \"kraut rock\" aspects. To highlight the rock aspect of the recordings, this line-up of DWM was given the moniker \"stone trio\". Professionally mixed and mastered by Alex Kammerer and Schwarzmann, this recording also features the best sound quality of a live DWM recording to date. Stadlmeier, HumanHate666, Acid Discharge and Kopfschmerztablette are featured as special guests on the last, extended experimental track.",

            "about": "Before his death in 2011, Conrad sent Joseph B. Raimond a large amount of unfinished recordings and unused cover art for DWM to augment and complete for collaborations. He never talked about his illness, and it came as a complete surprise to hear about his death soon after. The ten tracks on this release represents the first set of many of the resulting collaborations, and feature, what else?, the typical experimental nature of Conrad's audio efforts with the strangeness and humour typical of DWM. Limited to 300 copies, this release on the fine Tourette Records label out of Texas, USA features a beautiful gatefold, full colour cover.",

Features the classic title track, composed by Bernard H. Worrick while “in the field” on military maneuvers. Other stand-out tracks include “Punk Floyd” and “Walking With Little Or No Torso”. Features Absurd full color cover of fish with penises (and one with boobs!) on the front, and an MC Escher spoof of fish giving each other blow-jobs on the back. Classic DWM. Edition of 500 copies, includes a lyric sheet poster.",

            "about": "Part seven in the on-going series of saw-blade shaped vinyl singles on Musical Tragedies. Each release is a split release between two artists. In this case, DWM shares the record with Controlled Bleeding. The DWM side is exclusive to this release, and features Andropovski screaming through a barrage of total noise. This track is by far the most \"industrial\" track so far released by DWM. Also included are performances by Joseph B. Raimond, Peter Schuster, Frans De Waard, Andropovski, Michael Wurzer, Emil Beaulieau and Adrian Gormley. A photo of Peter and Joe on the inside by .mario., taken while waiting for the Ringo Starr concert in Aschaffenburg to start. Both bands are loud, experimental, and made to be played at maximum volume. First pressing of 500 on multi-colored vinyl, second pressing of 500 on clear.\nPlease note: as DWM does not claim to own the rights to any music other than their own, we can only offer the DWM track of this release for downloading and streaming.",

He compiled, edited and partially remixed this album himself of his favourite tracks, and added new sounds and samples to make some of the tracks quite different from the \"normal versions\". Stefan also contributed the cover and label art for this, one of DWM's more guitar and rock oriented releases.",

            "about": "This album was so important for DWM as it was the very first vinyl album. The vinyl freaks that DWM are, we really wanted one of those typical American style LP covers, just like those old worn out Beatles albums everyone all knows and loves, where the cover is actually printed on paper, and then glued onto a cardboard cover. When this came out, Ron of RRRecords, who handled the pressing in the USA and whose label co-released this with eMpTy, claimed that it sold out so fast that it was the only record he ever released that was sold out before he could put it into his catalog! Musically, it is one of DWM's typical hybrid albums, featuring both guitar oriented tracks mixed with industrial and experimental, and although the production can be rough, it has stood the test of time and remains one of the best DWM releases. Standout tracks include \"The Human Prospect\", \"Joel Selvin Can't Dance\", and both parts of \"Everyday\". Recorded from May 1987 through May 1988, and ncludes an insert. Edition of 500 copies, it is today very rare.",

            "about": "The “Slow” trilogy has at its core the concept of slowness. Everything about the three releases is slow. It takes a long time to record them. Once recorded, it takes forever to find a label to release them. Once out, they sell very slowly. Musically, they are all dominated by what one would call “ambient”, but in our case we prefer to refer to it as “slowbient”. No searing guitar solos, no drums, no sudden changes. Each track is simply called “Slow”, and are numbered in the order in which they were recorded. Many of the slow tracks have appeared on various samplers. Originally conceived by DWM fellow cohort Ralf Lexis, this project has taken over ten years to complete!\nThe original Slow album, this recording only came out as a vinyl album. Interestingly, it was released by a label that would later become part of Hyperium Records. Musically it contains the first three long, slow experimental tracks (#’s 1, 2 & 3), that only gradually build up in strength and structure.",

            "about": "DWM expands into new territory with this release, both musically as well as graphically. Played in its entirety by Joseph B. Raimond, this recording utilizes a unique instrument built by the Italian master-builder Azaam Bells, is routed through effects, and is entirely improvised on one track without overdubs. It is both melodic if unstructured, as well as occasionally harsh. The entire cover art is an amazing piece of work as well by the Nürnberg area artist Wicky Reindl, realized as a series of photos utilizing hand crafted masks.",

Released on the revived and revamped Clockwork Tapes label out of Nuernberg, it is a limited, numbered edition of forty copies, each featuring a unique, one of a kind postage stamp depicting artwork by Joseph B. Raimond. The artwork itself is glued into the packaging, a special CD mailing envelope. Only available by mail from Clockwork Tapes, or through our usual DWM platforms Bandcamp, FB or Discogs.",

            "about": "PLEASE NOTE! This album is available on 12\" vinyl and CD at  elasticstage.com/docwoermirran\nThe Enlightened Redneck is a full length, instrumental vinyl only album that crowns DWM's forty year anniversary series of recordings. More political than many past releases, tracks include the provocatively titled \"Burn That Bridgeport\", \"Wrong Planet\" and \"Breitbart Burning\", as well as \"Flerfing The Deer\", a track that without any misunderstanding declares DWM's support of education and rejection of brainless conspiracy theories. Like many of their more recent recordings, this album attempts to combine various styles of music into one long, almost symphony, where one track merges and evolves into the next. Is it post-industrial krautrock? How about progressive garage experimentalism? It is all this and more. Assembled at DWM's very own Two Car Garage Studios in Fürth, Germany, it is the companion piece to last summer's \"Climaximum\" album and the soon to be released \"Instru-Mental\" and \"Supraliminal\" albums.",

            "about": "Long sold out, this CD was a split release with several tracks by both Controlled Bleeding and Doc Wör Mirran. CB check in on their half with some brand new recordings, exclusive to this release, that is a bit like Zappa on speed, with lots of fast paced edits and some nice vocal work. One song even has a sort of reggae beat to it. DWM offer as well new, exclusive tracks, with their usual amount of humor and garage-ness. Each band has their own cover that features their own artwork for this release. A limited, numbered edition was made in a double CD box with 50 hand-painted blank CDs.\nPlease note: as DWM does not claim to own the rights to any music other than their own, we can only offer the DWM tracks of this release for downloading and streaming.",

This one is an older project, recorded July 1988 - February 1989, and the first DWM recording planned specifically as a CD. Very experimental in nature, often almost industrial. 50 copies were done as a limited, numbered edition with the blood of Peter Schuster squirted behind the clear tray card. Needless to say, even a few hardcore DWM fans prefered the normal edition!",

Limited to 20 numbered copies, it features a hand painted cover on both sides, and is signed and numbered by Joseph B. Raimond. The labels as well are hand painted. Black vinyl, the music is pressed on one side only, the other side of which is a quite elaborate vinyl etching by Joseph B. Raimond and Bernard H. Worrick. Included inside is a small watercolor painting by John Eberly, and four art and poetry inserts. Musically, it is often very minimal and experimental, and is today one of the rarest and most requested DWM releases in DWM's long and prolific career.",

Imagine a utopian world, without money, without banks, managers and CEOs, where everyone looks after each other, where creating art is actually appreciated, where children are cared for and loved, and don't have to die of starvation. This is the soundtrack for that world. Recorded in 1997.",

            "about": "Described as \"almost music\", this is one of our more collectable releases, if only for the fact that it is on Sympathy For The Record Industry, probably the most collected and respected of all labels speciallizing in 7\"ers. Originally called \"Screaming For Titties\", this title was changed due to objections by the label's distributor, Mordam. (Of course, we gave this title later to our split saw- blade with Controlled Bleeding). We had thought that this record was going to be pressed on blue vinyl, but it ended up being on black anyway. Blue and black printed covers, 12 paged booklet printed black on white. 1200 pressed, in the USA. Released late 1992. Features J.B. Raimond, B.H. Worrick, R. Lexis, P. Schuster, Jeannette Gustavus (doing a great imitation of Grace Slick!), F. Abendroth, Andopovski, Theodor T.ThrongoMob, Matt McNeil, Denise and Deanne Kusiak, J. Mervin and A. Gormley.",

            "about": "The fifth single on another label, as well as the 51st (!) DWM music release and the 59th DWM release so far (including books). The title of the record of course makes great fun of all those incredibly boring MTV “unplugged” recordings. This is more guitar oriented, dominated by Ralf Lexis songs. Recorded at both Lexisound and at Two Car Garage studios in 1993. Three songs in total, the second of which, “”Blisters Of Mercy”, features Dick, Phil and Jasper of Citizen Fish/Subhumans, and we are happy to have them with us. Also appearing is Joseph B. Raimond, Peter Schuster (debuting on vocals, guess where!), Denise Kusiak, Ralf Lexis as we already mentioned, Jeandra Raimond who did the front cover lettering, Bernd De Payrebrune who did the great Albrecht Dürer “art” in the booklet, Jeannette Gustavus and Andropovski who wrote the poems in the booklet, and Bernd Spörl who helped title the songs. Cover, label (only one is printed!) and 8 page booklet are black and white printing. Also, this is the only DWM record where the inside of the cover is also printed, featuring a list of all the DWM members who are NOT on the recording (just like Crass used to do!). Pressed on both purple and on black vinyl, 500 made, released in December 1995.",

            "about": "One of the oldest unreleased recordings in the DWM vault, \"Walm Art\", which was recorded over a quarter century ago just as DWM was settled in the Nuernberg area, has finally been released. These recordings come from roughly the same time as the albums \"Save The Fish\" and \"Severe Pig\". Originally titled \"Fred's Got A Satelite Problem\", we changed the name when the original artwork was found to be missing. Released in a special clear plastic box, the \"music\" on these recordings are typical early DWM, full of nonsense and stupid humour, but a lot of fun to listen to if you don't take it too seriously. Containing a grand total of 38 tracks, it features the talents of Joseph B. Raimond, Bernard Worrick, Ralf Lexis, Matt McNeil, Manni Schumann, Jeandra Raimond, Frans De Waard, Peter Schuster, Mike Pelzo, Axel Ruhland, Denise Kusiak, Frank Abendroth, Volker Zippelius, John Eberly, Ski, John Mervin, Adrian Gormley, Namu, Theodor T. ThrongoMob, Rich Ferguson, and John Flansburgh.Wow!",

Released in 1993, it features many DWM members, including J. Raimond, P. Schuster, B. Worrick, .mario., Andropovski, F. Abendroth, E. Beaulieau, F.DeWaard, R. Lexis, D. Kusiak, O. Van Essenberg, J. Waddingham, M. Wurzer, J. Eberly, L. Gabiot and J. Mervin. As with all Prion releases, very experimental in nature. Both C-60 tapes packaged into an old tobacco can, with the art wrapped around the can. Each band has a long strip of art and info which is rolled into the can. All art is fotocopies, some on colored paper. Over the top of the can is glued a small strip of paper with the band names.",

            "about": "During DWM's fortieth anniversary, their longstanding wish finally came true, with founding member Bernard H. Worrick returing to the fold as an active member of DWM for the first time in over thirty years. Michael Wurzer wasted no time and immediately began working on a new DWM release featuring the recording input of Bernard H. Worrick, who also took the cover photo, and the result is Weltschmerz, a new full length DWM studio album, their first release in 2026. More industrial and harsh than many of the newer DWM recordings, this fine release is also noteworthy in that it is the first DWM release without the input of the other founding member Joseph B. Raimond. Further cover art by longtime DWM member Adrian Gormley.",

Much more experimental than most material by these artists, this album features a handmade cover and is limited to 200, numbered copies. Mr. Ebu performs here as a solo act, one very long track divided into several subsections that is almost hypnotic. DWM here is a two-piece with original members Joseph B. Raimond and Adrian Gormley, performing live versions of such DWM greats as \"Wish You Weren't Here\" and \"Himeola\".",

Raimond had the chance to work with an old Buchla modular synthesizer, some of the results of which ended up on the first DWM self-titled cassette, released in 1984 on eMpTy Records. Ever since, he has wanted to continue these experiments, and got the chance almost forty years later once many of these old systems had been recreated digitally and offered through the internet. One of the more abstract DWM releases, this entire, roughly one hour long composition is the result; a composition of random, modular synthesiser sounds. Collage art on the back cover by Michael Wurzer and Simone Seng, insert art by Adrian Gormley.",

Always a very enthusiastic member of DWM, due to his time-consuming job and serious health problems, Frank was not able to contribute to DWM as much as he wanted. One dream come true for him though was this release, recorded on his portable four track cassette deck, which was originally titled \"The Hospital Tape\" as it was literally recorded in the hospital while he was recovering from one of his many illnesses. The first set includes pieces with vocals added in typical Frank humour, while the second set is instrumental. Between tracks are bits of an audio letter Frank recorded for Tom Murphy, but never sent and recorded over. Recorded in Seattle, garage quality pure, but what a fun release! Cover art by Joseph B. Raimond and Jeandra Raimond. Includes a small finger painting as well by Peter Schuster.",
