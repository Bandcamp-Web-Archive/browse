            "about": "\"A Distant Reflection\" is the 10th in my series of long form Ambient/Experimental works which started in the beginning of 2020.\nThis track started out with just the sound of two drinking glasses being tapped together in various ways recorded with my Zoom portable recorder about two weeks ago.\nThis week I imported the recordings into Ableton and with some editing made some rhythmical elements from the sounds, further manipulations of the sound resulted in some inspirations with my prophet Rev2, creating some atmospheric pads/drones that shift in key forming a foundation for some improvised synth work using my Supernova II, The Korg MS20 Mini, The Moog Grandmother. Multi-tracking these synths a couple of times to build up a rich sonic canvas. One other sound recording from my zoom was also added, a rather mundane domestic chore that was manipulated a little to hide the source but to add some mystery..\nThe basis of the track was composed in one evening.\nThe following night I retuned and added some subtle yet improvised piano keys courtesy of the Native Instruments Maverick Grand Piano instrument.\nThe final challenge was to make this work as a long form piece.\nI arranged and mixed and mastered it the following day.\nI hope this latest composition gives you as much joy and calm to\nlisten to it as it did for me while working on it.\nMick Chillage July 2020",

            "about": "A Distant Reflection was originally written and recorded in 2020 and was originally released as a long form digital release only. Clocking in at almost 60 minutes long \"A Distant Reflection\" explores the relationship between deep shifting atmospheric synth drones, unusual found sounds/field recordings and emotive improvised key sections that bring a sense of stillness and subtle emotional impact.\nUpon its original release the feedback from various supporters was very strong and it has been one of those digital pieces that some have requested a physical CD release on a few occasions and as a personal favourite I felt it was time to release it on CD.\nSome of the supporters feedback on the original release.\nmickchillage.bandcamp.com/album/a-distant-reflection\nb_d:\nI slept so well! really chilled and wonderful :-)\nAmbientcosmos:\nBeautiful, drifting, immersive soundscape.\nDimitar_Dodovski:\nSoothing, pastel cloud of ambient tones reminiscent of Eno's Apollo. Its floating and cycling quality makes it suitable for thinking, relaxation or art installation!\nDavid Prescott:\nAn absolutely favorite from one of my absolute favorites. An excellent long-form ambient track from a master of the genre.\nFor this 2023 CD release I decided to return to the track and I have made some subtle changes to the mix and arrangement. the addition of further stereo enhancement, additional FX sweeps giving it a more dream like essence in certain moments and changing the end with the reappearance of the improvised piano as the track fades away.\nTo fill the CD I've also included to brand new compositions which I feel compliment the title track but also stand on their own as shorter pieces.\nThe album \"A Distant Reflection\" clocks in at almost 8o minutes of somewhat personal thought provoking reflective ambience to immerse yourself in.\nI hope you enjoy this new version and its accompanying pieces.\nMick Chillage\nMay 2023",

            "about": "In early August 2020 I was tinkering with my rather basic 5 note Kalimba, I liked the harmonic tones I was getting from it by strumming it and letting my fingernails drag over its keys or lamellas as they are known as, playing randomly and rhythmically.\nI decided to record an improvised session using my Zoom H1 recorder.\nI imported the recordings into Ableton live and started to manipulate the recordings in various ways, which created an eerie/alien like metallic sound which became the foundation of the track.\nI then turned to the Moog Grandmother and tuned it to the manipulated Kalimba and began creating various patches, improvising and recording and multi tracking until I had a structure that began to work for me.\nFor additional depth, I turned to the Prophet Rev2 and I created some polyphonic atmospheres/drones that shift and became the second foundation.\nOnce I had enough elements to play around with I began to arrange the individual performances/recordings with the hope that the elements would work as a long form piece.\nDuring this time, the track seemed to take on a life of its own, the mixing and arranging seemed almost effortless a synergy of acoustic, analogue & digital technology resulting in an alien yet haunting feel but with a sense of hope and optimism.\nWell that's how it speaks to me.\nMick Chillage Sept 2020.",

            "about": "\"Abandoned Memories\" was written and recorded in late summer/early autumn of 2023 and sees myself returning to my more introspective reflective improvised style of ambient music with perhaps a hint of Neo classical?\nThe first piece written was \"Remember to Forget\" and In recent years I seem to have developed an interest/fascination in music composed around a foundation of sustained drones. Although \"Remember to Forget\" opens with a simple atmospheric chord progression it was the pulsing/bouncing like synth that was essentially the starting point of the track. The piano part was composed over these two elements along with the haunting breathing like voice synth.\nThe title track was born from a sustained drone that has some shifts in amplitude & frequency, I sat and improvised some keys for a while with a couple of different passes, one in particular resonated with me and I then made some edits to it fixing where I was either a little too hard on key velocity or too low and also fixing any notes that felt a little out of time in some places, some passes have slightly different nuances in notes and FX etc to keep a natural feel.\nThe addition of some recent field recordings and additional subtle synth accompaniment assisted the lengthy improvised passages and aided the long form arrangement of this piece which I hope works as an emotive yet comforting place to immerse yourself in.\nThe middle piece \"Reconcile\" is the shorter of the two but applies a slightly different approach, an initial improvised synth pad acts as the main foundation with some simple but emotive high key counterpoints, a subtle minimalist ambient piece that creates a different yet coherent mood.",

            "about": "A shorter version of \"Acceptance\" was originally released on one of the popular Neo Tantra digital compilations series in of Spring of 2020.\nWritten during the first part of the pandemic I always felt that the track could have been longer, so about one month back I retuned to it. The Covid 19 virus certainly marked a time for us all where we had to make some very serious changes in our lives and adapt which caused a sense of uncertainty and fear in most of us.\nIn all our personal lives we sometimes are forced to make changes at times, this can be very painful or frightening but during this process we can become better versions of ourselves or it can be an awakening to gifts or qualities we were not aware of.\nMy intention with the extended version was to subtly add new musical pieces or atmospheres that reflected the changing/challenging times we live in with perhaps haunting or uncertain tones yet also moments that suggest we are about to go through a collective metamorphosis which may bring a better world in the future.\nMick Chiilage August 2020",

            "about": "I guess it was the arrival of Acid house/Techno in the late eighties that began my true journey deep into electronic music, sure before this movement happened electronic music was already on my radar from the wonderful soundtracks of John Carpenter, Vangelis & Tangerine Dream etc to UK acts such as Art of Noise, Depeche Mode & Cabaret Voltaire & of course the perfect synth pop of Kraftwerk had already left a huge influence on me.\nBut there was something about these alien sounding dance tracks that captured my attention & got me hooked. The acts behind these works were mysterious and in many cases you could tell these tracks were made with very little equipment and often not a great musical ability but with a lot of imagination & passion, this was kinda like a new movement of electronic punk.\nOver the years the sound merged and mutated, some stayed firmly underground and others more mainstream, many times it became predictable and overused and I got bored with the sound on some levels.\nOver the years I myself have incorporated the acid sound in some of my Ambient, electro, techno tracks etc but in late 2023 I began to think the Acid sound had maybe run its ground but there was some unfinished business with the relationship I have with this sonic culture.\nI asked myself \"Why not go back and create a body of work that tries to respect the original sound yet delivers something new that feels like hearing it all again for the first time, a challenge indeed and only you the listener can decide if I have come close.\nJan 2024 I began to work on material utilising some limited analogue equipment to begin with, just to keep it in the spirit of many of the early tracks, quickly ideas began to form and develop. I was mindful that these tracks would need some variation in style and BPMS so 909s 808s and other drum sounds were incorporated.\nBy mid Spring of 2024 I had about eleven pieces that I was very happy with. Some are pure acid Techno/House jams with a dark underground edge, others are more playful in moments & some are home listening atmospheric acid works that draw later influences that utilised the acid sound.\nI hope you enjoy this first volume of Acid Forms and I hope to complete Volume 2 before the end of 2024.",

            "about": "Taken from the blurb of \"Acid Forms Vol One\"\nI guess it was the arrival of Acid house/Techno in the late eighties that began my true journey deep into electronic music, sure before this movement happened electronic music was already on my radar from the wonderful soundtracks of John Carpenter, Vangelis & Tangerine Dream etc to UK acts such as Art of Noise, Depeche Mode & Cabaret Voltaire & of course the perfect synth pop of Kraftwerk had already left a huge influence on me.\nBut there was something about these alien sounding dance tracks that captured my attention & got me hooked. The acts behind these works were mysterious and in many cases you could tell these tracks were made with very little equipment and often not a great musical ability but with a lot of imagination & passion, this was kinda like a new movement of electronic punk.\nOver the years the sound merged and mutated, some stayed firmly underground and others more mainstream, many times it became predictable and overused and I got bored with the sound on some levels.\nOver the years I myself have incorporated the acid sound in some of my Ambient, electro, techno tracks etc but in late 2023 I began to think the Acid sound had maybe run its ground but there was some unfinished business with the relationship I have with this sonic culture.\nI asked myself \"Why not go back and create a body of work that tries to respect the original sound yet delivers something new that feels like hearing it all again for the first time, a challenge indeed and only you the listener can decide if I have come close.\nJan 2024 I began to work on material utilising some limited analogue equipment to begin with, just to keep it in the spirit of many of the early tracks, quickly ideas began to form and develop. I was mindful that these tracks would need some variation in style and BPMS so 909s 808s and other drum sounds were incorporated.\nBy mid Spring of 2024 I had about eleven pieces that I was very happy with. Some are pure acid Techno/House jams with a dark underground edge, others are more playful in moments & some are home listening atmospheric acid works that draw later influences that utilised the acid sound.\nSome work continued into 2024 which lead to a further three tracks being completed so both volumes have seven tracks each.\nI hope you enjoy this second volume of Acid Forms.",

            "about": "\"Alba Paltera\" was written and recoded in April of 2023.\nThe two main sound sources are analogue synths;\nThe Moog Grandmother, where some long shifting evolving modulated drone patches where recorded at various pitches and then layered. The Prophet Rev2 provided the more subtle poly ambient textures which give the track that break from the ominous dark and heavy alien tones which are the foundation of the track.\nThe Moog is also used for a sequence section that shifts in and out that suggests a sense of discovery or a deeper sense of mystery.\nWhile working on the arrangement, the music began to conjure otherworldly visions of an alien landscape being explored or monitored from a safe distance as hi tech devices send back various data on this new and fascinating planet, a cliche maybe but one that fits the soundscapes that emerged from my mind to my synths.\nEquipment used:\nMoog Grandmother\nProphet Rev2\nKorg SQ1 seqeuncer.\nAbleton Live 10 for audio arranging and digital manipulation of some sound sources and FX.\nHope you enjoy!\nMick Chillage April 2023.",

            "about": "Initial Programs is my alter ego which was born in 2016 from the idea of starting from scratch on a synth that its program parameters have been initialised to zero & building sounds from there with a canvas that is open to myriad of influences within electronic music.\nThe first release \"What Tomorrow Brings\" in 2017 was a three track EP on 12\" vinyl that blurred the lines between Techno, Electro, IDM etc.\nThen in 2023 the album \"Are We Programmed\"  mickchillage.bandcamp.com/album/are-we-programmed\ntook these concepts further and incorporated Ambient, touches of Jazz, experimental electronics, soundtrack influences that merged with many contemporary groove based electronica genres the album also featured the tracks from \"What Tomorrow Brings\"\nThe third Initial Programs release \"Alter Of Illusions\" started in 2024 which takes a tougher and more brutal edge at times, mutating the 80s and 90s blueprint of Techno & Electro with raw analogue aesthetics sitting with some widescreen ambient atmospheres & 21st century digital manipulations/production techniques creating a world where each piece has a sense of shifting sonic architecture both familiar and alien in equal measure.",

            "about": "\"Altostratus\" was written in spring of 2023.\nThe initial idea came about when I was experimenting with the FM synthesis capabilities of my Novation Supernova II, although its one of the oldest synths in my arsenal, this is an area of the synth which I haven't explored all that much.\nI ended up with a pretty basic yet classic sounding FM bass and played a longish improvised/shifting bass-line that kind of carries the track along throughout its duration.\nThe other elements came together quickly with some sounds edited and played from my Prophet Rev 2.\nThis day in particular was a pleasant spring day and as the clouds rolled by my roof-light window I decided to record the sounds that were present outside and recorded a couple of passes of distant traffic and a jet plane overhead.\nI tried to capture an accompanying soundtrack to those moments where I would often lie down and watch the clouds pass by on those warm summer days on the bank of my local river, I returned to my archive of field recordings of this area and included another recording which captured some environmental/naturalistic aesthetics.\nI was very pleased how this track came about in a short period with the addition of some subtle improvised keys it added further emotional sentiments.\nI hope that this thirty minutes of Ambient music can add a sense of calm and peaceful/comforting familiarity to your day.\n\"Autumn Falls\" was also written in the spring of 2023 but its inputus goes back to November of 2022 where I had captured the roar of my local waterfall after a heavy few days of rain. In spring I recently acquired an acoustic guitar and purchased a new microphone, my intention was to simply capture some guitar textures and maybe play some basic chords or plucked elements.\nI had said to myself \"as an experiment, no mater how simple the first part I play and record is, I will try to create a piece of music from it\" So, the basic picked guitar phrase was used as the foundation to \"Autumn Falls\" the recording of the water fall was added along with all the various synth parts and FX that completed the track and feels like the perfect companion to \"Altostratus\"\nI hope you enjoy!\nMick Chillage March 2023",

            "about": "The concept for \"Amen Forms\" came about while I was compiling tracks for another possible \"Orphaned Tracks\" volume. I came across a piece I had been working on way back in 2017 \"The Forgotten Trail\" The track already had a sort of breakbeat feel with some programmed drums but I felt an additional break beat mashed up would bring additional dynamics, I added the classic Amen break sample and played around with the track some more, I was kind of inspired and began to think of how versatile and how many styles this hugely influential drum loop had adapted to so well over the many decades of electronic music.\nOver the next couple of months I had the concept in my head and as various tracks came together some new and some unfinished ideas I would add various permutations of the loop, spliced and digitally manipulated in as many forms as I could within different genres.\nThe end result is seven tracks all with quite distinct themes/aesthetics spanning different genres & BPMs; From very serious emotional & atmospheric pieces to more playful pieces.",

            "about": "I've always had something of a phobia with the wind, particularly when winds reach storm force and you can hear and feel things shifting by its power, yet of course a light breeze on a warm day is welcome and pleasant.\nLiving in Ireland we regularly have Atlantic storms that cover Ireland particularly through the autumn months & during these I find it hard to relax and sleep at night as my sensory sensitivity anxiety begins to to take hold.\nSo, the inspiration for this album came about sort of unexpectedly with the opening track \"Boreas\" and its wind like sweeping tones & somewhat dark & foreboding aesthetic. Initially I thought maybe I'd call this track \"Ancraophobia\" the technical term for fear of the wind.\nAfter some googling I was led to the greek mythical god Boreas and this seemed to fit better.\nI found it fascinating that there was individual gods for each wind known as the\"Anemoi\" [Gods of the four winds] and kept this in mind as I worked on more tracks over a pretty short period of time with each track trying to reflect the character of each wind god.\nFrom a production aesthetic I wanted to create the soundscapes purely synth based and avoid adding any natural sounds of wind being used and instead went for white noise and resonant sweeps and deep bass amongst other techniques.\nI hope you enjoy my latest work that explores one of natures forces that can be both pleasing & destructive.\nMick Chillage January 2026.",

            "about": "I wasn't planning to release any new music until end of June with my next CD album \"Brain Oscillations\"\nLate spring/early summer 2022 has seen the sad passing of four deeply influential figures within electronic music.\nFirstly the passing of Klaus Schulze a hugely influential figure often coined the Godfather of Techno which my forthcoming \"Brain Oscillations CD is influenced by and dedicated to.\nNext we had the passing of Vangelis a household name in electronic music due to his wonderful soundtrack work and a career that spanned six decades with a myriad of musical styles that always had a sense of majestic melody and timeless beauty.\nIn the last week Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode sadly left us at only sixty years of age. Many of us grew up with Andy as we watched DM mutate from their early synth pop to a deeply influential electronic music group that matured and have written and produced so many timeless albums that often defy genre.\nAnd lastly we lost Dave Smith the incredible talent behind the Sequential synth brand and many iconic instruments like the Prophet series and also developed the MIDI system which redefined the electronic music creation process in the late 80's.\nTrack one \"Anisotropic Synchrony\" was created with only Prophet sounds but with some additional digital manipulation on some source material.\nTrack Two \"Astronauts Eye\" is more experimental Ambient and continues with the theme of Light and the phenomena that astronauts often experience is space with light. This track was written only two days ago.\nTrack three \"Extinguished Light\" was composed shortly after the passing of Vangelis and is of a somewhat sombre yet otherworldly tone.",

            "about": "Mick Chillage, the hardest working man in (ambient) show business, has joined forces with Eric “the” Taylor to make our daily lives go down just a bit sweeter. They’ve coined themselves the Architects of Existence, and, yes, it’s a weighty moniker, but listening to these four epic-lengths pieces of broadband drift you’re happy that the dynamic duo’s at least got lofty ambitions. It’s pleasing to know that between them they’ve cooked up one helluva work of sonic fiction here. Grandiose, epoch-spanning, this is the stuff that dreams are made of. Chillage and Taylor are two of electronica’s Nobel laureates so that even the luxurious gyrating buzz of their metallic sequencers make nice on the inner ear while their synths gently weep. And hats off to the artists for wearing their analog hearts on their sleeves—the second movements’ slow-twist discourse is equal parts Steve Roach and mentor Namlook, along with a hint of Mark Isham’s score from The Hitcher–emotional environmental music of pearlescent luster and quiet reckoning, drawn with careful poise and an Architect’s touch.\nPurchase CD's or downloads from:\narchitectsofexistence.bandcamp.com/album/architects-of-existence",

            "about": "The alias \"Initial Programs\" is a Mick Chillage project and was born in late 2016 after creating a track where all the sounds were created from scratch, basically from the default Initialised program setting of my Mopho X4 synth along with my MS20 mini etc.\nThe track I created appeared to have a lot of my electronic music genre influences, Techno, Electro, touches of the IDM movement, Ambient, Acid, so I thought to myself, wouldn't it be an interesting project to create a release that brings together as many of my influences as possible by merging them into each track.\nIn 2017 I had finished the first EP and this was released through First Cut on 12\" vinyl in early 2018 and was very well received from many well known Techno & Electro DJ's and producers. This kept the momentum going to hopefully create an albums worth of material.\nSo over the last few years I continued randomly producing works with this alias in mind with the hope of producing a full length album and by early 2022 I began selecting tracks to make a coherent album.\nAugust 2023 finally sees the release \"Are We Programmed\" a twelve track album that features the three tracks from the EP for First time on CD and nine new previously unreleased works.\ncredits\nreleased August 30, 2023",

            "about": "Upon a recent sweep through my hard drive, I came across which I believe is the very track I created using just my newly acquired Prophet Rev2 synthesizer back in 2018. With its rather Space Ambient theme or a Berlin School approach.\nI felt it sat well with another recent production & a track that initially was started for a collaboration which turned in a different direction.\nSo I returned to the three pieces to make a thematically coherent mini album of sorts, I hope you enjoy.\nMick Chillage\nMay 4th 2020",

            "about": "Originally released on CD at Before & After Silence Recordings Bandcamp\nIn 2018 I released \"Between The Endless Silence\" on Carpe Sonum Novum. This album was a collection of Improvised Piano based ambient works that I had created between 2015 to 2016.\nShortly after these works were completed and selected for the album I continued to work with this momentum of piano based improvisation pieces into 2017 where the body of what is now on \"Between Moments\" was pretty much completed.\nThe original five pieces clocked in closer to one hundred minutes of music which was way too long for a single CD release and I was very happy with how these pieces had turned out I waited until the right time came along to release on CD.\nI put this project away [on hold] for some time but it was never forgotten and it would regularly pop back into my mind that I would need to complete it and arrange it for a CD release.\nIn 2022 I returned to it over a period of time and re-arranged some tracks to get it just under 80 mins, luckily no musical elements were lost and I was very careful not to loose any of the tracks emotional. atmospheric impact during the edits.\n2024 I return to it again with fresh ears and fix some mixing details and issues. By early spring I'm very happy with the new arrangements, mix etc and decide this will be the 2nd release of 2024 on Before & After Silence Recordings.\ncredits",

            "about": "The inimitable Mr. Chillage seems to go from strength-to-strength with each and every new release, armed with a diligent, focused work ethic and a surfeit of imagination, which makes his latest Carpe Sonum Novum missive a pleasant, diverse surprise. Perhaps he’s immersed himself in Harold Budd and Tim Story records, as he’s chosen for this release to center his already gorgeously pealing whorls of ambient discourse around the keystrokes of the piano. But wait: lest you roll your eyes and bemoan the entry of yet another electronic musician who fancies himself a ‘classical’ composer, Mick’s tickling of the ivories isn’t mere folly or a gestural jape. Instead, the artist has, intentionally or inadvertently, created a paean to the elegaic minimalistic sides forged by Mssrs. Budd & Eno, couched in the softly irising synthetic thermals he’s arranged over countless works in his formidable catalog. “Between the Endless Silence” isn’t therefore your typical piano-centered blandishment, nor a stuffy bit of experimentation, or even its creator’s desire to abandon his chosen field. Instead, Chillage has done the next to impossible, recontextualizing the delicate filigree of the acoustic grand throughout a wonderfully luxurious fabric of electronica, refracting a veritable font of melodies that linger in the head long after the disc concludes. Had this been issued in the early 80s, it would be considered a well-established classic; we’ll just assume that right now, and brandish it accordingly. Play it late at night or early in the morning; either way, it’s more brilliant than the sun.",

Encompassing the sound of improvised key performances, field recordings & subtle synth Ambience's it reflects the physical world around us with its beauty & decay and perhaps triggers memories and emotions from the regretful to the hopeful, like a sonic capture of a thoughtful reflective pause.\nWhat the label said:\nThe inimitable Mr. Chillage seems to go from strength-to-strength with each and every new release, armed with a diligent, focused work ethic and a surfeit of imagination, which makes his latest Carpe Sonum Novum missive a pleasant, diverse surprise.

            "about": "In 2018 I released my \"Between The Endless Silence\" CD album on\nCarpe Sonum Novum, the album was quite a bit of a departure from my usual Ambient recordings, although on some previous works I had showcased some moments of improvised or composed piano works.\n\"Between The Endless Silence\" was a very personal body of work that was based around the piano and focused more on thoughtful and sentimental compositions, subtle ambient undertones and field recordings.\nSitting somewhere between Modern Classical/minimalism.\nThe Title track \"Between The Endless Silence\" which finished the album\" is a 20 minute piece of gentle looping piano phrases, field recordings and haunting soundscapes. Over the years, I've had several requests for a longer version, as some people have said it worked very well for meditative purposes and has helped them with anxiety etc..\nSo I decided to return to the piece to see if I could extend it and mix it with some new subtle musical parts that change the mood a little, perhaps a little darker but to return you to the serenity of the original. I'm quite pleased with this extended version and it sits well with the three other new/previously unreleased tracks which were recorded in 2017, 2018, and \"A Chair And A Window\" which was most recently written and recorded in May 2020.\nI Decided this new version shall be titled \"Beyond The Endless Silence\" and Ideally played at the end of this album, due to its duration and subtle nature you may drift in and out of sleep but certain themes will fade and return so hopefully you won't miss all the elements.\nI really feel the album should be played at low to medium volume and with minimal distractions.\nDedicated to the memories of Natalie & Ziv who sadly left us on May 14th 2020.\nAlbum was given a 24Bit Remaster in Jan 2025",

            "about": "Brain Oscillations is a return perhaps to a more Ambient Space Music aesthetic after the rather organic and poignant piano based \"Urban Nature\" although I would consider this more like head space music.\nThe initial impetus of this release was born from the sad passing of Klaus Schulze an artist that was synonymous with the \"Kosmische Musik\" of the early 70's and someone who was very much regarded as one of the true pioneers of this music which spawned from the early experimental kraut rock movement in Germany.\nThe passing of Klaus had shocked and moved the electronic music scene across the board, his trademark hypnotic sequences had left a huge influence on the dance music scene that emerged in the 80's and continues today which is why he was given the hefty title of \"The Godfather Of Techno\" but there was so much more to his music than this.\nSo, upon his passing I found myself revisiting some of his works and reading the liner notes of a particular album Klaus had described his style of music creation as \"Brain Oscillations\" this very distinct & descriptive term got me thinking about possible music that may inspire me and perhaps be my own homage to his influence.\nAt first I thought it would probably be just one piece of music if I was lucky enough to get inspired. The first track I created which is the opening piece was born from the deep ascending shifting poly synth sound I had created from on my Prophet Rev2 that appears at the twelve minute mark. I turned to my trusty Moog Grandmother and built up a selection of various modulated frequencies, these formed the slowly developing intro of the track as more sustained poly drones & classic sounding synth parts etc were added. The bones of track one was developed in one evening.\nI also made a conscious decision not to use any sequenced synth parts as I felt this would have been the most obvious element to emulate but instead to use lengthy poly synth chords, drones, keys, leads and wild synth modulations that suggest a burst of neuron activity or that may stimulate the mind on a sensory & emotional level.\nLuckily this mindset of creative thinking led me to completing two other tracks within a short time frame which I felt had a strong continuous theme.\nFor KS.\nEquipment used on this album.\nDave Smith Prophet Rev2\nMoog Grandmother\nKorg MS20 Mini\nEmu ESI 4000 sampler\nElectro Magnetic contact Mic\nAcoustic Guitar\nAbleton Live 10 for audio sequences mix and digital FX & treatments.",

            "about": "Celestial Observations was created in Autumn 2020, the album only utilises sounds that came from my various synthesizers.\nWhat started out as experiment with layering monophonic drones, created mainly on the Moog grandmother at first it developed by various modulation patching of each part the sound would morph and change over time.\nI recorded these long droning/morphing passages and eventually built on top of these foundations with some polyphonic patches I created on the Prophet Rev2 & Novation Supernova.\nIn some pieces however they only consist of monophonic sounds, on tracks one & four.\nWithin a few weeks I had the bones of an album, six tracks in all but I narrowed it down to five pieces, the omitted piece will be used elsewhere in the future. I felt these works definitely had an other worldly expanse to them and had a sense of dark & light and gave me a feeling of exploring the vastness of universe & beyond.\nThe title \"Celestial Observations\" seemed apt\nI hope you enjoy my return to the more \"Space Ambient\" spectrum on this album\nMick Chillage\nFeb 2021.\ncredits\nreleased February 15, 2020\nWritten, mixed, recorded at the Igloo Dublin 2020 & 2021\nArtwork Tony Obr",

            "about": "The first \"Celestial Observations\" album was the second release on Before & After Silence recordings & one of the best sellers on the label so far, its mix of spatial drones, improvised synths, experimentalism & atmospheric aesthetic appeared to appeal to the Berlin School/Space music fans as much as the Ambient minimalist drone appreciators as I feel it fell in between these two spheres.\n\"Celestial Observations 2\" continues with these themes but this time I created the album with the intension of it being something listened to in one sitting.\nTen tracks shift and morph through dark & light passages of varying duration that pays homage and respect to the amazing minds that invented the various telescopes that enable us to view the cosmos and gather more insight to many theories & mysteries that have fascinated star gazers since the dawning of man.",

            "about": "In early May of 2023 I had an accident on my BMX bike and suffered a fracture to my skull just above my eyebrow and also a concussion as a result.\nJust before this accident I had created a new patch on My prophet Rev2 which kind of reminded me of those eerie bell like tones sometimes heard on Aphex Twin/Locust records. During my concussion I found it very difficult to focus on anything and creating music was difficult, but three weeks later I went back to the patch and built up a track mainly utilising this sound in various ways.\nAlthough not fully recovered and working in short time spans of maybe 20/30 minutes per night a piece began to emerge and within a few days I knew I had the bones of something worthwhile. As my condition improved I finally arranged and mixed the track which became \"Supraorbital\" [Thanks to Dave @ Carpe Sonum for the title] a twenty five minute piece which has two distinct movements.\nThe other two tracks \"Circadian Rhythm\" and \"Zeitgeber\" were pieces which I had been working on prior to my accident and with a bit of additional work they seemed to fit the theme that had developed.\nThe title track \"Circadian Rhythm\" & \"Zeitgeber\" relates to the cycle of our sleep pattern which now had become somewhat disturbed for me as I slept much of the day and now had trouble sleeping at night, thankfully this has pretty much resolved.\nA \"zeitgeber\" is any external or environmental cue that entrains or synchronizes an organism's biological rhythms, usually naturally occurring and serving to entrain to the Earth's 24-hour light/dark and 12-month cycles.",

Neuromantek\n02 Living Large: Friendly Strangers. Unnamed\n03 Chicago Pad: Late Night Express. This Side Music\n04 Veymix: Mindfield. Psychonavigation\n05 The Light That Burns: Die Welt Est Klang.

            "about": "In 2009 I released my second EP \"Departure\" for Irish based Techno label Nice and Nasty now in their 20th year.Nice and Nasty are better known for their more dancefloor friendly cuts so the title \"Departure\"seemed more than fitting for the release that consisted of four \"Chill Out\" or \"Downtempo\" electronic music that ranged from elements of Jazz to soundtrack inspired ambience to bleepy and bass driven frequencies.\nShortly after the release of the original EP a collection of remixes followed, a remix EP of each track every three months which saw the likes of Finlands IDM master Lackluster turning out a couple of rather stunning glitchy yet emotive remixes.\nDave Anderson [Ferox] Showing of his distinct freestyle keyboard playing style amongst some funky yet minimal grooves.Tomas Jirku's remix went off on a really deep musical and majestic vibe.\nIreland's new techno shinning light The Parellel turned out a solid chunk of abstract electro which got some airplay on Dave Clarke's White Noise radio show and UK based IDM/Classical\nveteran Pentatonik delivered an epic cinematic remix of The Final Storm.",

            "about": "Lorenzo Montanà and Mick Chillage are practically veterans across electronica’s many-splendored plains these days, as both artists have been virtually inescapable these past few years. Both FAX alumni, with additional releases scattered across a worldwide range of labels, it was almost inevitable that the two should someday join forces. Deviazioni Cosmiche is the result–eight tracks of gripping, lovely starcrush and void descent, where both artists seamlessly merge their diverse intelligentsia to yield a powerful tour de force of synth structure.\nSince each musician’s back catalog has painted vivid pictures of brusque environments and alien topographies, this collaboration is no different, but what makes it a crowning achievement in their respective pantheons is the sheer dazzling display of sounds on hand. From the post-Vangelis be-bop of “Vinctos Temporis” to the spectral misty mountain climes of “Microsopic+Mechanisms+Moon”, the end result is a wonder to behold, full of towering peaks and abyssal valleys, hesitant percolations and demonstrative beatstorms. Begging for repeated listenings and multiple exposures, this one might well go down as a future classic of its form.\ncredits\nreleased June 3, 2016\nAll tracks written and produced by Lorenzo Montanà and Mick Chillage. Mastered by Lorenzo Montanà.\nUS orders and downloads  carpesonum.bandcamp.com/album/deviazoni-cosmiche",

            "about": "\"Devotology\" was originally released on Before & After Silence Recordings in late January 2024.\nDevotology is the study of cosmic devotion, its role in the achievement of astrosis and devotional practice in Astronism.\n\"Devotology\" was created between late 2022 and 2023. I initially composed and recorded \"Polytheism\" in December 2022 as a ten minute dark drone Ambient piece and returned to it a few months later and was inspired to add more synth parts and keys etc which progressed the track with a deeper spiritual or other worldly sensibility I bounced back and forth between other projects and built the final mix and arrangement knowing that it felt like the beginning of a possible theme.\nTrack three came next \"Auroral Devotion\" [but under a different working title] in April 2023 some random sound design experimentation lead me to the main shifting polyphonic pad drone, I kept doodling and experimenting with various other synths and played various parts until I arrived pretty quickly with part 1 of this piece.\nI sensed that the track could be longer but I didn't want to just simply arrange the existing elements as they where so I got heavily into playing around with the source material which was purely analogue to began with.\nI decided to explore within the digital realm to achieve an unusual mood and aesthetic for the second part that subtly mutates & drifts into other sonic dimensions.\nThe final piece to be recorded was track three \"Sol\" recored in late summer of 2023 which was inspired by the sound of my malfunctioning Solar panel pump system which was in need of a service. I climbed into my attic storage space with my Zoom H1 recorder and captured various cycles the pump was now making, these unusual sounds became drones and eerie mechanical pulses & clonks which where loped and manipulated in various ways. The addition of some poly synth parts, mono leads and FX added a more musical feel to the strange foundations.\nThe idea that this sound came from my solar panel system and basically the power of the sun made me think about our brightest star and how important it is for our existence and it led me to the concept of an album based on ancient and modern worship of celestial bodies in their many forms.\nI saw a connection between the other tracks that somehow had a cosmic fascination and everything just fell into place it seemed.\ncredits",

            "about": "In recent times I've become interested in the idea of tracks that are based around a foundation of sustained drones/textures, chords etc which are then layered with improvised keys, textures & melodies, found sounds etc but keeping a certain level of minimalism yet rich in atmosphere.\nIn early 2024 I began experimenting with tracks with this technique in mind & from time to time I would add tracks to a folder that I felt fitted the concept.\nBy late 2024 I pretty much had the bones of the album now presented to you, with a little bit of additional mixing in early 2025 and it was completed. I feel this a cohesive collection of deep yet atmospheric & emotive ambient works that explore different worlds & moods that goes beyond what the term \"Drone\" usually conveys.\nThe album includes a sequenced mix of all the tracks.",

            "about": "E.I.M.(Experiments In Mono) was created in late jan 2020.\nMy goal was to experiment with just one Mono synth, in this case with just the Korg MS20 Mini, Korg's reproduction of the classic mono synth from the late 70's, famously used by just about everyone.\nPlaying around with various patching and front panel editing I would improvise on the keys, some parts musical and others very experimental. Once happy with each part I would then record into Ableton and eventually built it up to seven different audio parts stemming form just the MS20, each part is of different durations, causing some interesting evolving movements, rather than endless repeating 8 or 16 bar structures that are omni present in much of todays strictly structured electronic music.\nThe twin oscillators and the parallel High Pass and Low Pass filter with their own independent modulation controls, the MS20 sound can result in some very organic sounding tones. One element, sounds to me perhaps like the ghost of a jazz saxophonist jamming with the wild ring modulations while someone else plays a retro glitching Japanese computer game in a water filled cavern while a haunting synth lead joins in to add some further mystery.\nHowever you the listener will interpret this cocktail of analogue sound and digital FX etc is up to you, but I do hope that it conveys something that can keep your attention and stirs something in your imagination for the almost one hour of its duration.\nMick Chillage May 2020\nNovember 2024 I created a new 24bit master of both versions.",

            "about": "From the early nineties I dreamt of producing my own electronic music after hearing that acts like LFO, Orbital etc had produced much of their work from small bedroom studios. After much investigation in to the equipment they used, I realised that it would not be so cheap to obtain the equipment needed, at this time analogue synths were still the only way to create these sounds as digital synthesis seemed to be for experienced programmers.\nIt wasn’t until the mid 90’s that a new breed of digital kit started to emerge, gone were the unfathomable interfaces of the DX7 and the mega expensive sampling workstations like the Fairlight. Companies like Roland started to realise that musicians wanted the ease of use that analogue kit gave, plenty of knobs for instant real-time manipulation and control.\nOne piece of kit caught my eye, The Roland MC303, my understanding at the time was that this machine was part bass line emulator of Roland’s classic TB303 acid box and their famous 909 and 808 drum machines. The price seemed reasonable, I thought great! I can learn how to program drums and play basslines etc and eventually progress to another synth for more sounds but when I got it home I discovered it had much more, Piano’s, Strings, Pads, Leads, FX and an eight track sequencer!!\nOut of the box and with a few days of getting to grips with its basics the MC303 was an instant dance music machine with some obvious trance/dance preset sounds and sequences, but if you dug a little deeper and avoided the presets other styles were possible.\nListening back I still get that sense of creative innocence within the compositions and production, maybe that was due to the MC303's limitations or my new found artistic endeavours? but I feel I its appropriate to pay respect to the little grey box that paved the way for many more budding producers in the mid to late nineties.",

            "about": "In March 2012 I released my “Early MC303 Tracks 1996 to 1998 Volume One”.A collection of tracks which showcased some of my early productions which covered many genres within the electronic music spectrum. For Volume One I mainly selected tracks from my minidisc recordings archive as many of the tracks were no longer stored on my MC303's memory. From these original recordings I edited and mastered them in Ableton live.\nSo after the success of Volume One, July 2012 will see the release of Volume Two. This time many of the tracks sequences were still contained within the MC303’s memory so I was fortunate enough to be able to re-record many of the tracks into Ableton and mix and arrange within the program.\nI have been very strict to not get lost using Ableton’s wide range of features and FX so I kept the tracks original feel by staying within the restriction of the MC303's architecture, so I only used the maximum of eight track sequencing, two simulataneous effects and low pass filters etc.. just like the MC303.\nOne or two of the tracks also feature the mighty Korg Prophecy\nwhich I added to my set up in early 1998 but using the MC303 to sequence on one channel only due to the Prophecy’s monophonic and single timbral system.\nAgain it has been great fun revisiting these tracks and brings me back to a time when I was still listening to so much music and drawing inspiration from many genres which is clearly evident in both collections. I’m still very proud of most these tracks and it is great to be able to release these early recordings finally, something that has been nagging in my conscience for many years.",

The six distinct Ambient/Environmental pieces were written in the order as they appear within the album.\nA mixture of recent and old field recordings, various synthesisers, electro acoustic sound sources were utilised to create this work.\nMy goal was to create an album that reflected certain earthy environments & a diversity that our planet can offer but also something that went a bit beyond just sonic textural qualities & hopefully something that would offer a subtle musicality that would conjure certain emotions or trigger memories of places once visited or even creating imagined landscapes for the listener.",

These elements naturally guided me to the rather dark & atmospheric yet mystical aesthetic, I was mindful of keeping the tracks sparse regarding the amount of additional elements I added to keep from getting too cluttered and to retain a sense of vastness and endless space.\nI hope with the four tracks contained I have delivered something within the deeper side of Ambient, drone that stirs the imagination and the soul in some way.\nMick Chillage\nJune 2024",

            "about": "In June 2024 I released \"Expanse\" a four track Ambient album that was like a sonic snapshot of the vastness and wonderment of space.\nI was very pleased how this album turned out and was still charged with inspiration to explore these themes in newer and different ways.\nLate June I continued to work/experiment on some new pieces just to see where they could take me and I had not consciously decided to make a sequel but I guess subconsciously I was pulled back into the world of \"Expanse\"\nBy early July I had the bones of four new works that definitely fitted with the previous aesthetic but with a broader scope perhaps. Mid July I worked on the arrangements and mixes until I arrived at a destination that made me realise this was definitely a sequel to \"Expanse\"\nI hope you enjoy this next journey into the Expanse!",

            "about": "Exulansis...The tendency to give up trying to talk about an experience because people are unable to relate to it,whether through envy or pity or simple foreignness which allows music to drift away from the rest of your life story, until the memory itself feels out of place, almost mythical, wandering restlessly in the fog, no longer even looking for a place to land.\nMick Chillage presents us with ten pieces of music that clock in around 4 hours with additional remixes from Joel Tammik & Si Matthews and\nDarren McClure\nExulansis was also released as a limited USB stick through  www.txtrecordings.co.uk\nMastering:  www.blackparticle.com/index.html\nArtwork:  www.instagram.com/_ninrud/",

            "about": "\"FAXology\" was my debut for the legendary Fax records, home to some of the greatest names in electronica like Klaus Schulze, Biosphere, Ritchie Hawtin, Anthony Rother, Move D, and of course label boss Namlook himself and many many more.. As the title suggests \"Faxology\" is a collection of Fax inspired works and was released on the eve of the labels 20th anniversary.\nOver the years \"FAXology\" has been falsely presumed & stated by some people online that the album was possibly created with the use of sound samples from various Fax releases or that Pete had commissioned the album to be created as an homage to his label.\nAll of the sounds and musical compositions were created from scratch on various synths & Pete was not aware of the album until the demo was sent to him. The album demo was untitled and after some lengthy discussions back and fourth Pete suggested \"FAXology\" as a title and I agreed.\nOfficial release statement from Pete Namlook\nwww.namlook.de/infos/PS08122.html\n\"This is the debut of Mick Chillage on FAX. Pete Namlook: \"When I first heard the demo I was blown away... I was wondering if this was a live show of Tetsu Inoue and me ...\" so close and yet a very own creation of music that it totally reminds of the 90ies music that made FAX +49-69/450464 a trademark in Electronic Music. Right before the 20th anniversary this album came at the right time forming a great and fresh reminiscence of what for Pete is part of his past, present and future\"\n\"FAXology\" on CD has now become a rare Item with occasional copies popping up at ebay and discogs etc..\nGraphics By Andre Ruello  www.flickr.com/photos/sansserifgrafik/\nDedicated to the memory of Peter Kuhlmann 1960 to 2012",

            "about": "This version was originally released through Before & After Silence Recordings in November 2022 on CD & digital.\nIn 2011 I fulfilled an artistic dream to release music through one of my most influential electronic artists Pete Namlook and his cult label Fax records, whom I'd been following/supporting passionately for almost 20 years.\nIn very early summer of 2011 I compiled a selection of tracks which I felt had a certain Fax aesthetic or influence yet had my own sonic feel, I nervously sent these to Pete.\nHe kindly messaged me and said he would listen within a few days, which he did. His response came something as a shock as he was really into the demo and wanted to release it within a month to wrap up his usual summer break.\nInitially I was perhaps expecting that if he was to like it that he may suggest some additional changes like shorten some tracks or maybe such a track could benefit with another musical element or mix. Pete was ready to master the album straight away and I trusted his ears and impeccable taste that it was perfect as it was. I did not in anyway want to suggest that perhaps some additional time could be spent on one or two tracks incase I missed an opportunity to release on Fax records.\nPete and myself discussed some possible fitting titles, he had said that upon listening to it at first he felt it was like hearing a lost live recording that perhaps himself and Tetsu could have recorded yet it was something new also and it it felt like it was a glimpse of the past, the present and maybe the future of the Fax sound and as the twentieth anniversary was approaching this landed perfectly and Pete suggested \"FAXology\" and I sat with it for a day or two and it just seemed to fit with everything.\nSo, \"FAXology\" was released on Fax in June of 2011. it was my second full length CD album and it helped hugely with getting my name as an established Ambient/electronica artist.\nOver the years I had contemplated a re-issue as original copies are rare and fetch collector prices on sites like Discogs etc. A version appeared on my 09-19 CD box set but it has not been available separately.\nIn 2020 I set up Before & After Silence Recordings and i had stated that I would reissue some albums \"FAXology\" was high on my list but in 2019 due to a violent thunderstorm my old laptop and connected hard drive suffered a catastrophic frying form lightning that struck the house.\nI believed that all of the old project files were lost forever.\nCut to 2021 and during some renovations at the house I dug out an old box of cables and other old computer peripherals from my attic storage, in the bottom of the box there was a USB stick, curiously I plugged it in only to find a folder that read \"Live sets\" I opened it and there was pretty much all of the tracks from \"FAXology\" in a live session capacity.\nOver the next few months I painstakingly reworked all of the tracks within Ableton to match the arrangements of the original CD but making some improvements to the overall mix, enhancing the stereo panning and movement, utilising individual effects for each channel as I now have a much more powerful Mac rather than using sends from two master effects channels. Some more subtle differences in the arrangements and use of filters etc.\nTrack four \"Control Room\" was always one I felt could have been expanded on, I like the original and its rather minimal feel but for the 2022 version I added some additional sparse sounds.\nI still hold a huge lot of love for the original mix and master but wanted to give fans something a little more with this re-issue rather than just repressing it with the original wavs. I was fortunate to have Lorenzo Montana on mastering duties, Lorenzo whom is a brilliant solo artist but also worked close with Pete on the excellent Labyrinth series it felt right to have someone to sprinkle that final bit of sonic magic to this new mix of \"FAXology\"\nRevisiting this album was a joy to rebuild and work on, I was careful to make the changes very subtle but hope that those who enjoy the original will find something new and enhanced that makes the listening experience all the more rewarding and also I hope that maybe a new audience will discover and enjoy it.\nTo Peter Kuhlmann I am eternally grateful.\nMick Chillage Dublin October 2022.",

            "about": "\"From Shores To Stars\" was initially conceived from a rather\nTechno like progression I had created on the MS20 Mini back in April of 2020. I went back to it some days later and felt it had something more to it than just laying down some typical 909 grooves.\nSo I slowed the sequence down in pitch and added some High Pass Filter's with some modulation sweeps and various effects I duplicated the sequence and pitched it up some more to give some extra layers, it began to sound other worldly.\nI returned to some experimentation with the MS20 and after some knob tweaking and patching I was surprised that I ended up with a somewhat human sounding tone, I played some notes and it sat well, adding a haunting quality, this sound is the introductory sound of the piece.\nI then moved to the REV2 for some further inspiration a bit of tweaking and a bit of improvisation lead to a dreamy lead like passage. some high frequency random melodies were added to create, perhaps a twinkling of stars effect.\nTo the best of memory some white noise sweeps from the MS20 were created for the rumbling shore like sounds and then a subtle synth sequence to give it a bit of a retro Ambient touch.\nAll sounds created on two Analogue synths with some further editing and digital manipulation in Ableton live 10.\nRecorded mixed and arranged and mastered in live 10.\nJanuary 2025 the track was given a new extended mix and 24Bit master",

            "about": "Its a beautiful weekend in late August 2020, I'm trying to relax\nwith some quiet peaceful music after a busy week at work.\nMy neighbours have other plans, to continue working on their new back garden patio, so the sound of a con-saw cutting through concrete has now become the soundtrack to this beautiful August weekend.\nNot to let it ruin my weekend I decided to record the sounds emanating from the ongoing construction site with my zoom H1, I figured it may come in useful at some point.\nA few days later, all is quiet and I decide to import and listen to the grinding and cutting of concrete. I drop the sound file into the sampler in Ableton and play around with loop points and pitches, filter etc, I find a pleasing sustained drone-like quality in a chord and the foundations were set for a possible new piece.\nI started off playing some string like sounds on the Moog Grandmother.\nSome more editing on the Moog Grandmother and I created a rather classic sounding Moog bass, patching the mod section into the noise generator to create a third oscillator, with a nice sustain and subtle sweeping filtering to add some movement on each note, I improvised a section and recorded it, I then pitched the midi up by 12 notes and had the Moog play the same section and then overdubbed the two parts to make a larger two note six oscillator Moog soundscape.\nThe prophet Rev2 is used for some polyphonic pad/string like sections.\nFrom this point I edited and multi racked the Moog some more, creating various alien like modulated sounds that appear through out the track. The MS20 produced the almost creepy bird like sound that drifts in & out as the piece progresses.\nOverall the track has a fairly dark ominous tone and feel. From about the thirty three minute mark a new Moog lead enters and adds a shift in mood somewhat which I felt was needed to make the track work over its almost sixty minute duration.\nI hope this piece conjures places & spaces in your imagination and\ngives you an hour of pure escapism to enjoy.\nMick Chillage Sept 2020.",

            "about": "\"Growth\" was born from the inspiration of both nature and my synths.\nOn a recent walk around my local park and across its rather impressive yet brutal looking suspension footbridge which spans across the river below I noticed the growth of lichen on its fabricated structure, the bridge is only a few years old and I was taken by the bright yellow fungi contrasting against the wine coloured painted metal supports and the black slip resistant walk way, I felt this would make a nice photograph so I took a picture with my phone.\nThe image kinda lingered in my brain longer than I expected and I was fascinated how the lichen was taking over the bridge, almost as if it was trying to blend in the alien structure to its natural surroundings.\nI began to see a connection between nature's ability to grow in the most unexpected environments and how growth can happen to us in unexpected situations, particularly poignant in the current pandemic we all find ourselves in, for many this has been a challenging time for sure but also its been a time of growth as we find new ways to cope and perhaps discover that maybe we should be doing things different in our lives.\nThe track itself, came about purely through experimenting with the Moog Grandmother initially, a random generative patch I created was the catalyst, by dialling various control knobs it created very varied and unexpected results, I also captured some drones that evolved from this patch and then built more synth parts from the Prophet Rev2, & the Supernova II, eventually the Moog elements became more like background effects and as the track comes to its final quarter I played some improvised keys using the Native Instruments Maverick Piano which I felt complimented some of haunting synth sounds.\nThe title \"Growth\" seemed to fit as the track grew from an unusual sonic foundation just like the lichen had grown on the metal of the very industrial and brutal looking footbridge at my park.",

That both \"Growth Pt1 & Pt2 were released individually digitally in 2020.\nSo check your digital collection to avoid duplication orders & also the same CD as released on Before & After Silence Recordings in October 2021.\nOctober 2021 sees the release of “Growth” on CD & Digital.\nThe inspiration came about while on a walk around my local park and across its rather brutal looking metal suspension footbridge which spans across the river below. I noticed the growth of lichen on its surface. I was taken by the bright yellow fungi contrasting against the wine coloured painted metal supports and the black slip resistant walkway. I felt this would make a nice photograph, so I took a picture with my phone.\nThe image lingered in my brain and I was fascinated how the lichen was taking over the bridge on certain surfaces, almost as if it was trying to blend the alien structure to its natural surroundings.\nI began to see a connection between nature's ability to grow in the most unexpected environments and how growth can happen to us in unexpected situations also, particularly poignant in the current pandemic, for many this has been a challenging time but also its been a time of growth as we discover that maybe we should be doing things different in our lives.\nThis inspired me to work on a new piece of music.\nThe title \"Growth\" seemed to fit as the track grew from an unusual sonic foundation just like the lichen had grown on the metal of the very industrial and brutal looking footbridge at my park.\nGrowth Part 2 came shortly after the first one, although a completely new composition it seemed to connect with the first one, another recent walk in my park and I noticed that one of the trees had a very tiny branch growing, on this infantile branch were some rather large new leaves. Strangely this was Autumn and whilst most leaves were dying these leaves were very green & luscious. I took a photo and some days later a new piece of music began to emerge.\nSo now I present “Growth” Parts 1 & 2 on one CD for the first time and in digital that clocks in at approximately seventy eight minutes.\nMick Chillage October 2021",

I took a photo and some days later a new piece of music began to emerge.\nOn this occasion the process was a little different. I started off late one night with the first improvised piano section that arrives later in the piece, I saved it and returned the following day. I knew it needed something as a foundation, i played around with some ambient chords on the Prophet rev2 editing the sounds, strangely the first piece I played seemed to compliment the piano musically and in tone.\nI then felt it needed something to bring more dynamic range and a further feeling, something that wasn't quite of this world or mysterious, further editing of some bell like tones and some extreme filtering and playing similar notes that matched the piano passage but at much higher octaves.\nI had this feeling that the piece would need something that swells and grows at some point in the track, I created a modulated drone with some shifting of keys but processed the sound further with some subtle overdrive & volume and rising reverb etc at perhaps the three quarter point in the album.\nI also turned to the Moog Grandmother and created a three oscillator pad patch with a haunting quality where I played another improvised section which arrives later, towards the end a new piano piece emerges a mixture of chords and individual notes along with some additional synth elements to gently wrap it up in a new direction to perhaps reflect a change a new life emerging in an unexpected place or way.",

            "about": "Hiraeth is a Welsh word that has no direct English translation, likens it to a homesickness tinged with grief and sadness over the lost or departed.\nPersonally I would consider myself to be apolitical and generally I am not one for expressing my opinions about situations that arise which I feel are beyond my scope of truly knowing all of the facts.\nHowever, when innocent people are thrown into a war it greatly sadness and angers me. The sense of helplessness is overwhelming, knowing that as one person, nothing I say or do can make a difference in changing the personal plight of so many, yet the sad irony is that it's usually one person who creates such awful plight for so many and the innocent on both sides ultimately suffer.\nWatching the events in Ukraine unfold on media as families are forced to leave behind loved ones, the homes, the lives, the communities they've built and not knowing if they may ever see such precious and deeply valued parts of their lives again is something I cannot even begin to comprehend.\nI began to think of ways I could perhaps help by utilising my artistic gifts?\nSo, I thought to myself that the next piece of music that I create I will donate all profits to the much-needed aid support agencies. Maybe pick two key agencies and split the profits between them.\nThe artistic challenge was how do I even begin to convey all the emotions that come with such a scale of human tragedy in a single piece of music?\nI kept coming back to the emotions of leaving a life behind, loved ones and close friends a country you loved, your home as it gets destroyed and so much more.\nI started with a blank canvas over the weekend and created some dark and ominous layered drones as a starting point, there's rather unsettling low frequency undercurrent that runs through the piece which suggest a sense of uncertainty and fear but as it progresses more tones and shifting pads & string elements rise and fall which I hope creates an important sense of hope.\nI recorded a live take and then mixed and arranged it into what is now a long-form Ambient piece which is very much in my own personal style of expression and I hope that I have created something that conveys the human side of this tragedy and that you my valued supporters may wish to contribute to my gesture of giving something to those who need it very much right now.\nI'm aware that I'm a niche artist but I'm happy that I can make some little difference through the help of my valued follower's & supporters.\nI'm setting the track at €3.00 or name your price.\nI will keep you all up to date on sales made and provide screenshots of both sale reports from Bandcamp and then most importantly the donation receipts.\nAny support will be greatly appreciated!\nMick",

            "about": "\"In Sequence\" is the result of various experimentations mainly utilising the Korg Sq1 Sequencer along with the Moog Grandmother, the Korg MS20 Mini & the Deopfer MS-404 which are all analogue mono synths.\nI would create various patches and then set to work creating sequences on the SQ1 often getting the SQ1 to have all of the synths running at the same time and capturing a live jam through my mixing desk for several minutes while manipulating and altering each synth on the fly.\nOther moments would involve capturing just one synth sequence and then over dubbing another completely different sequence over it, often repeating this process a few times until I felt I had a strong musical idea.\nIn some cases performing some polyphonic parts on the Prophet Rev2 along with some programmed poly rhythms of various genre styles also once recorded each audio part may have been further edited in the digital world & of course additional FX and mixing and arrangement until I had a piece that felt complete as a track rather than just an on the fly jam.\nI deviated with my sonic tools on \"Sequence Pt.3\" where I returned solely to my Waldorf Pulse 2 which I had not used in some time this gave me a burst of fresh inspiration and one of the sequences is maybe reminiscent of synth part used on Herbie Hancock's \"Rain Dance\" from his legendary \"Sextant\" album, this was not intentional but I was pleased to create a similar aesthetic & sequence by accident which was originally created on a Arp 2600 back in 1972.\nOverall the tracks contained explore various themes & genres from Berlin School, 90s electronica, Techno, Experimental IDM & Ambient to Jungle etc as I really wanted to explore what was possible with one sequencer and limited semi modular analogue synths/standard synths.",

            "about": "Jan 2018 see's my first vinyl EP release under a new alter ego \"Initial Programs\" on the Dublin based imprint First Cut.\nThe Ep entitled \"What Tomorrow Brings\" consists of three groove-based tracks, spanning genre's from Techno to Electro with hints of IDM experimentalism and influences of synth-based soundtracks.\nlimited to 300 vinyl copies with worldwide distribution.\nOrder vinyl from:  firstcut.bandcamp.com/album/what-tomorrow-brings-ep\nProducer and DJ Feedback\nSelected DJ Feedback:\nDelta Funktionen (Radio Matrix)\n“Sounds ace! When is the vinyl out?”\nLaurent Garnier (F Comm)\n“Really cool acid/electro tracks.... Niiiiiiice!”\nSunil Sharpe (Earwiggle)\n“A really nice few tracks here, very musical and sharply produced. 'City Speaks' is the standout for me. Reminds me ever so slightly of Plaid actually, but only a touch. Definitely in a positive way anyway! Great job.”\nJohn Heckle (Tabernacle)\n“This is great, old school & atmospheric IDM techno, right up my street. Thanks mate, will definitely be playing these.”\nNick Craddock (Uzuri)\n“These are great, thanks for sending them. Simple enough, structurally, but what sets them apart is that great grasp of dark melody. Definitely something I would play, and I fully intend to.”\nDan Curtin (Metamorphic)\n“First second of first kick drum I immediately thought of Adrenelin M.o.D \"Ecstasy\" and that feeling kind of continues through this entire EP. But of course this is something totally different, layered and rich, an acidic symphony that is kind of like story telling when you listen to all of the tracks together. Thoroughly into this.”\nDJ TLR (Creme Organization)\n“Oh this is very nice thanks.”\nHeinrich Dressel (Minimal Rome)\n“Just listened to the release and I must say it's very solid! Thanks for sharing. My fave is \"City Speak”.\nRivet (Kess Kill)\n“Nice one, reminds me of early B12/The Black Dog. B2 deffo the one for me.”\nDj Glow (Trust)\n“Really nice dreamy, yet snappy jams! will definitely play this on my next FM4 show.”",

            "about": "Like many of my works \"Integration Loops\" was born from a moment\nof pure inspiration, I was working on a project which seemed to be a little stagnant and I wandered off playing something completely different when a sound from another project caught the attention of my ears and senses again.\nI played some improvised keys, which is pretty much the foundation of the track, I liked its haunting sound, although purely electronic it has a somewhat organic tone, almost human like at times, something that my Prophet Rev2 delivers from time to time.\nWith this longish improvised phrase recorded I began to play yet another deeper counterpoint with a new sound patch which I edited to match the duration of the very first improvisation. The two of these pieces seemed to just sit together so nicely I kinda sat and listened as they both looped endlessly but each pass seemed to grow and shift in different ways to my ears, delivering a certain emotion that resonated with me.\nI kinda felt that these two elements could perhaps just play for an hour or so, with subtle filtering and volume changes and various effects being tweaked also, a fairly minimal emotive track but experimental with its long running time.\nBut as I prepared to arrange these, I couldn't help but delve further into more sound design and improvisation. I worked solidly for the rest of the evening, adding more elements but being careful not to clutter each part.\nI now felt I had the sonic ingredients for a long form track but maybe this time I could push it out further, utilising the freedom that the digital format can offer and going beyond the maximum eighty minutes constraints of my beloved CD format.\nThe following day, I began to mix & arrange the track and what you hear now was all pretty much conceived in just under two days. I hope I've achieved something that can keep a listener engaged for it's duration as it gradually morphs from emotive swells to calming, softer plaintive moments and to ghostly tones that appear briefly and to disappear into the almost endless sonic haze.\n\"Integration Loops\" clocks in at one and a half hours, and yes the title is kind of a homage to a particular well know Ambient series ;)\nEquipment used:\nProphet Rev2 16 Voice. (All sound sources)\nAbleton Live 10. Effects, digital processing, mixing, arranging.\nNative Instruments \"The Maverick\" virtual piano.\nWritten & Recorded September 2022 at the Igloo Dublin.\nRemastered in 24Bit February 2026",

            "about": "Inter-Dimensional Guidance was written & recorded in Autumn of 2022, it was one of those albums that seemed to arrive almost out of nowhere.\nMost of the time when I create music I prefer to start with a blank canvas with no real preconceived idea of what I want to achieve. The title track started out as just an experiment with my Moog Grandmother, creating drones that shift in tone by using the modulation matrix and the mod wheel to accurately achieve the desired tone and add movement.\nOnce I had arrived at the various desired drones I captured these in audio and then I instinctively edited and played what you hear as the track progresses.\nThe title track was pretty much written arranged and recorded over two nights, this was definitely the impetus to an unaware trajectory of creativity that continued over the following two weeks or so where the four following tracks emerged and I began to realise that a potential thematic album had emerged, almost as if I had been guided by an unknown outside force.\nThe themes within the album appear to be somewhat mysterious, otherworldly and perhaps those that explore other dimensions and spaces. It's strange that this album came together just as I was ready to release the newly mixed version of my FAXology album, is \"Inter-Dimensional Guidance\" the result of a subconscious desire to fulfil an often requested sequel to the album FAXology?\nMaybe or maybe not.\nEither way I hope you enjoy my latest deep & explorative album!\nMick Chillage\nFebruary 2023",

            "about": "Koromebi.\nIn real life, the space between the canopy and branches allows sunlight to gently filter through. In Japan, the dappled light this creates is called komorebi (pronounced koh-mo-reh-bee) and is made up of the kanji characters for tree (木), shine through (漏れ), and sun (日).\nIn late Decemeber of 2021 while on a countryside walk on an incredibly still day I came across a very peaceful mini forest that still had much of the fallen leaves from Autumn carpeting the forest floor.\nThe sun was low and the radiant beams of light really enhanced the already rich palette of vibrant tones at my feet.\nI rested on a heavy fallen branch and sat for maybe thirty minutes as the sunlight crept between the trees.\nThat night I had an inspired moment, the music that developed is at first quite still/calm and gradually it shifts in tone & colour over its thirty minute duration.\nThe next day as I listened back to what I had written, it sort of felt as if I had composed a sonic snapshot of that peaceful thirty minutes in the forest.",

Originally the water recording was pretty pedestrian, an everyday sound that I had to manipulate to create a feeling of perhaps being submerged or sinking in a deep cavernous body of water.\nThis led me to my Rev2 synth for all of the other elements, experimenting/editing with various patches trying to complement the deep aquatic found sound.\nFortunately the track came together within an evening and with some further mixing and arranging I ended up with a somewhat immersive dark long form Ambient track.\nMick Chillage\nMarch 2022",

            "about": "\"Lowest Forms\" was written in February of 2020 which utilises some very low frequency square & pulse waves, courtesy of the MS20 Mini with various modulation and improvised melodic and melancholic synth leads and some subtle and somewhat haunting polyphonic undercurrents and occasional slow motion caustic beats which fade in and out over its almost 60 minute duration..\nNote: The bass on this mix is very low at times, some adjustment of your bass levels maybe recommended depending on your tastes and speaker set up.\nI've also included an Ambient mix, where I have mixed the bass somewhat lower in volume and re-arranged the track and also added an additional subtle sonic element where the beats are in the Caustic Mix Version are removed.\nLowest Forms got a new mix & 24 Bit Master in December 2024\nThe [Alt Ambient Mix] has some new arrangement & sound additions.",

            "about": "\"Lowest Forms 2\" was created in early March 2020.\nI had no intention of making a follow up. I was mainly experimenting with my newly acquired Moog Grandmother and had created these interesting and haunting bell like tones. I also played around with some poly sounds on Prophet Rev2 and felt I was going in the right direction with a deep yet evolving ambient track. I then turned the MS20 mini and got this simple yet super low bass with some modulation that rises and falls, I recorded it and it seemed to fit as a really nice undercurrent.\nThe bass takes a while for it to appear in the track as it was pretty much the last element added.\n\"Lowest Forms 2\" may have a theme similar to the original \"Low Bass\" and \"Ambient\" sounds but both are very distinct tracks.. Hope you enjoy!!\nJanuary 2025 \"Lowest Forms 2\" got a new 24Bit mix & master.",

Chillage’s working methods are efficient to say the least, exemplary to say the most; the consummate musician, he’s not one to sit still or allow his muse to stagnate, equally at home channelling any number of sub-genres, be it fleet electro or galvanizingly intense atmospherica.\nHis latest for Carpe Sonum after the wonderful Saudade release finds the erstwhile sonic frontiersman alternating a beautifully involving series of tracks that deftly straddle spheres both inner and outer.

            "about": "September 2023 sees me returning to my ambient works after the previous two releases which explored Techno, Electro, IDM under my Initial Programs alias and varied Breakbeat excursions with \"Amen Forms\"\nThe title track \"Marius Reigo\" was created in July of 2023.\nThe track at its core has a haunting sonic foundation, yet as the track progresses new tones and moods shift in & out. As I worked on the piece various concepts and ideas happened quickly.\nWith just utilising my Prophet Rev2 I was able to achieve the right aesthetic which feels like observing another world while receiving various signals from an array of hi tech instruments, some sounds are alien and mysterious others are calming and familiar.\nI hope that all of these morphing and layered elements make its forty minute duration a deep and engaging listen.\nIts companion \"Ganymede\" recorded in Early September and has a darker atmospheric feel from the outset with its deep shifting analogue synth drones and its mysterious chimes and mutated alien chatter which comprises of a mixture of field recordings found sound and analogue synth experimentation and improvisation.\nThis album is dedicated to the memory of Andew Hartnett.\nAndrew, along with his brother Dave were behind Dublin's cult XFM radio station. I'm eternally grateful for your kind friendship, shared talents, passions and your valuable time which you so generously shared during those fond early days.\nRest in peace Andrew.",

            "about": "Over the years I have received some very nice emails that my music has been an affective tool for some of my listeners with their particular mediative practices & sleep issues.\nAlthough meditation is something I had never practiced myself I often felt that the creative process was a similar experience in that your focus goes away the from endless stream of thought often negative and it worked as an escape from my often over working mind.\nIn recent times I have had some struggles and challenges which had become amplified after a severe head injury and I really needed something to help with the rather slow & fluctuating recovery.\nIn the past I had tried to meditate but found it very difficult and didn't receive the desired results from these attempts, this was probably mainly due to my lack of understanding in the mechanics and a lack of belief in the process.\nRecently while watching some David Lynch related videos on youtube I found out that the much loved movie writer & director was a advocate of a particular kind of mediation. I found this fascinating as I find him to be a super interesting human on a creative, philosophical, & spiritual level.\nA sixteen minute video of him explaining his particular practice made total sense to me and it gave me a new perspective & decided to attempt some sessions with a new found enthusiasm.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Em3XplqnoF4&t=2s\nWithin a few days I began to feel some benefits of this, however the mind mantra wasn't the most fitting for me and decided to try with just sound which I felt worked better and less distracting.\nFrom this experience I decided that maybe it would be a good idea to create my own meditation sound works that I could tailor make to fit the desired 15 to 20 minutes or so that most people find the most suitable duration for meditative sessions.\nI was mindful that these works needed to be minimal & not suggest any particular feelings or thoughts but needed some movements that you could focus on and follow. I just used my Prophet Rev2 Synthesiser and started with a raw two oscillator patch and edited from these until I had a sound that I felt would work well with sustained notes firstly and then some gentle shifting repeating/alternating chords that could be gently manipulated via filters, modulation & subtle effects over varying times.\nWhile I have not studied the science of frequencies that may work best I just followed my ears based on what I consider calming sound and notes.\nThere a four pieces to use or choose from and I hope that at least one of these may work for meditative purposes or at least as a sonic backdrop to aid a sense of calm and relaxation & maybe even aid sleep.\nI'm offering these pieces free as a Thank you for all of the very kind support wonderful feedback that has inspired me to continue with my music creation over the years.\nMick Chillage\nMarch 2024",

            "about": "For many years I've wanted a Moog synth in some form, however many of the newer models felt a little unlike the originals from the innovative days of the synth giant.\nIn the beginning of 2020 finally I decided to purchase the Moog Grandmother a semi modular synth that looked and felt like it could have been released in the early 1970’s, its digital side is almost hidden to the eye, just basic midi implantation via USB and no preset/patch storage, just a raw patchable synth with some of the original module components of their classic modulars of their pioneering days. This had the heritage and hands on approach and sound I had dreamed of and I was not disappointed.\nSo I began to experiment with the Moog on various evenings and weekends, at times recreating sounds that sounded just like some of the tones on the Dark Side Of The Moog series and many more classic albums. I would often get goosebumps hearing these classic Moog sounds, just by dialing some of the control knobs and some basic cable patching, this would often result in some awesome inspirational sound!\nI would immediately jam with the sounds that inspired me and just record long improvised passages, more editing and more playing and recording, multi tracking until I had the foundation of a track. Often the bones of a piece could happen in a few hours and the next day I would mix and arrange a finished piece in a digital environment. The Moog became very intuitive quickly and also led me to sound creation I never expected from Grandmother.\nI guess it's safe to say I never truly set out to make a Moog themed album, there are also some of my other synths used where I needed some polyphonic sounds. Many pieces had come together very quickly and I just placed them in an unreleased folder as I usually do, eventually going through the various tracks and selecting ones that make a coherent listen or experience and the ones I chose just seemed to connect in a way that felt right for a new album.\nDuring this period with the Moog I was in various states of mood and some sounds triggered certain memories, hence the title.\nMoog's Moods & Memories was released on CD through Neo Tantra Recordings\nin Autumn 2020.",

The four tracks are based around a foundation of field recordings which have been looped, pitched and effected in various ways.\nVarious synth drones, pads & improvised keys etc tell distinct sonic narratives which should keep the listener engaged during its forty minute plus duration.\nI wasn't initially planning to make a sequel or series as such but in January of 2025 over the space of a few days I had a very creative streak & the bones of four new tracks emerged rather organically.\nSonically the tracks reminded me of the very open to interpretation aesthetics of the first, although no field recordings are utilised on part 2, mainly synths & occasional found sounds. The rain forest like sound for example on \"Virtual Nature\" was created by digitally manipulating wildly modulated oscillators recorded via the Moog grandmother.\nI decided to complete the tracks as a follow up to the original, making sure each piece had its own strong identity that conjured different worlds, dimensions & mind states.\nI hope you enjoy the four new pieces of Morphogenic Realities 2.",

            "about": "MS-V-MS was created back in late December of 2019.\nIt started out using just two analogue mono synths and\nthe Prophet Rev2. The MS-404 by Doepfer which you can hear\non the intro with its spaced out 303 style acid tones.\nI then added some haunting poly pads, thanks to the mighty Prophet Rev2. as the track progressed I decided to add some programmed drums, heavily edited and effected, causing some Heavy distorted industrial like tones.\nThe Korg MS20 mini appears, as a counterpoint in the track or mood change with a rather dark and large two oscillator pad sound which I coaxed out of the mono synth after some editing.\nThe greatest challenge was seeing if I could make this piece work\nas a long form track with the fairly sparse number of tracks and elements.\nI jammed with the elements live first to see how each movement, drum part and tweak-able parameters at hand would work, the piece kinda took on a life of its own.\nSo what you hear now is almost 60 minutes of a live arrangement which was then edited to remove some moments that either got too loud or perhaps a little cluttered.\nI hope you enjoy my venture into Acid, Ambient, IDM and Industrial noise.",

The track has been revisited for the 2021 release with some edits and arrangements & the addition of two new tracks that compliment the main long form piece.\n“MS-V-MS” sees Mick exploring a tapestry of spaced out Acidic synth lines, haunting Ambient tones that shift & morph into passages of dark ominous analogue swells & Intricate poly rhythms with a driving industrial presence. Resulting in a flowing synergy of IDM intensity & otherworldly ambience.\nThe title track started out using just two analogue mono synths The Korg MS20 Mini & the Doepfer MS-404 hence the title. Other synths & various production techniques were used to complete the piece.\nreleased April 27, 2021\nWritten, produced, recorded & mastered by Michael Gainford\nat the Igloo Dublin 2020/2021",

            "about": "This album is formatted for a gapless audio experience..\nNight Works conveys a range of emotions that the closing twilight hours can often bring. Deep soundscapes shift like moonlight as shadows in darkness crawl across a lost landscape. Occasionally there’s a sense of melodic comfort, like being cocooned in the warm atmosphere of your own home while some moments invite you to venture outside to witness the nocturnal activities of a vast darkness. Like a storm from nowhere, strange unidentified frequencies emerge in the distance and converse like a room of spirits that echo the sound of past nightmares. Glimmers of light appear as cities dream of hi rise sunsets.",

            "about": "\"Nocturnes Resonatiae\" was created in early November 2020.\nthe inspiration came from experimenting with the Moog Grandmother\nvery late at night. Through various patching and tweaking a rather bell like tone emerged from the synth I played some various notes and added reverbs & delays it seemed to feel like distant yet eerie church like bells ringing in the distance.\nThis lead me to experimenting further with my two poly synths the Prophet Rev 2 where I found another sharper bell like tone, some further editing lead me to a more distinct ringing sound, I played some improvised keys and captured a passage that complimented the eerie Moog elements.\nSome more polyphonic moments from the Supernova II added a moody sustained string like section and a rather ominous deep sustained bass drone that you feel as much as you hear. other elements, strange modulated Moog & Korg MS20 added further mysterious tones with subtle movements.\nI feel the piece conjures the early hours of a still night, perhaps in a city and the various mysterious sounds that emanate in the distance or right where you sleep as various devices continue to function through the night.\nThis piece is open to the imagination of you the listener in whatever way you want to interpret it.\nMick Chillage November 2020\nIn April 2025 the track was given a new extended mix",

            "about": "Oceanus Procellarum was written and produced in October of 2022.\nIt was the second piece \"Gravitational Anomalies\" that was created first by using just the Moog Grandmother, creating the trippy bass sequence first and then the improv synth lead. The track sat on my hard drive for a week or so as an unfinished idea sketch.\nA few days later from a patch creating exercise on my Prophet Rev2 I created an interesting deep pad with shifting filter frequencies, I played two separate pieces using the newly created sound that worked as a dark shifting atmosphere.\nOther sounds developed and there seemed to be a relationship of dark and light, with the right arranging and placing of the various elements all with slightly different bar durations over time, all of these musical motif's will interplay with one another and create new subtle counterpoints yet retain its overall mood, so hence a track for a long form experience hopefully.\nOnce the piece was finished, I felt the other Moog based sketch may fit with a theme that sort harks back to the more hypnotic style of Ambient electronica of the early to mid 90's also with hints of 70's style Berlin School.\nSo, I retuned to \"Gravitational Anomalies\" with a mindset to make it more hypnotic/atmospheric and also introduce some downtempo polyrhythms, in a sort of downtempo breakbeat style but with a somewhat experimental minimalistic feel.",

With most of them I had to return to and add additional elements, create more refined arrangements and better mixes to make sure I had the best quality representation of each piece.\nI hope you enjoy this latest volume of Orphaned tracks",

Over the years I've delved into some Dub influenced tracks either in Techno, Downtempo or Ambient. This piece kinda sits within all of these genres.\nI had the foundation of this track completed and felt it needed something else, I reached out to an old friend of mine Kitty whom I knew had a wonderful voice, singing in choirs, worked with Irish dub artists etc.\nI sent her the instrumental and she came over to my home studio and pretty much laid down the ethereal and soulful vocal textures in one take.\nThe track also features some dialogue from a particular underground movie which adds a another emotion and dynamic to it.\nAll synths, basses and drums are played and performed by myself.\nI was always hoping that this would sit within a particular project but always felt it kinda stood out on its own, finally its time to share with the world after some ten plus years.",

                    "about": "This track was an experiment when I purchased the Native Instruments Session Strings. I wanted to see if I could compose/arrange a somewhat orchestral piece although with no proper theory in such things it may not be what is possible with what a real live string ensemble can do.\nOverall I was quite happy with the end result, I spent quite few nights arranging and mixing it. There is also some subtle synth ambience textures in the mix here and there.\nI enjoyed making this track but I doubt scoring this kind of music for film would be an area I would be successful in unless I studied this are in more depth.\nI now occasionally use the Session strings vary sparingly on some of my other ambient pieces etc.",

The further addition of complex programmed drum parts and mutation of each drum element created a very experimental IDM track.",

A Lot of jazz music is often just comprising of a trio of musicians, drummer, bass and keys or wind instrument etc.\nI wanted to see if I could created something along the lines of acoustic jazz but within the digital realm, this is not the first time Ive created similar works.\nI've always been fascinated by the brilliance of Coltrane's \"Love Supreme\" and its bass with its distinctive simplicity, this was a starting point to see if I could create a simple bass hook that I could play something more free/improvised over.\nI love the Rhodes and it always inspires. There is however one additional instrument; a synth lead improv in the middle and some editing and manipulation of the drum section to try and keep the percussive elements interesting.",

A few attempts to do more with the drums didn't seem to work. I left the track for years and then a catastrophic crash meant I lost the project.

Used just the one famous disco loop and built the track with my Supernova II which I did not have very long. I submitted to the comp but didn't win. However at a busy Dublin club night I gave the DJ who I barely knew a CDR, the club was hoping and he mixed it into his set to my surprise! I was super happy that the dance floor stayed full while my track played.",

I was a big fan of Carl Craig's 69 works etc and his sort of proto-jungle techno, I decided to look for some breakbeats, from what I can remember the first one I came across I knew as soon as I heard it that was the one! As soon as I dropped it in, the rest of the track just came together with ease.\nAdditional drums were programmed and a tribal loop sat well along with the additional synth stabs that give a sense of urgency and that undercurrent sustained phased drone added further suspense.\nUnfortunately I could never find the original audio stems/samples as this track was created pre Ableton, and it was a mixture of midi Sysex sending back to my Supernova synth, midi triggered via Logic, samples saved on Iomega Zip drives all mixed live and recorded directly through an analogue desk to CD recorder.",

The acoustic guitar part was kindly played by my friend Neil, I kinda hummed the simple phrase and he got it exactly.",

With Moodswings the baseline and jazzy percussion appeared in a piece of music isolated for a moment, the bass is just a turnaround part of the track, it only appears once for the two seconds or so, it seemed like a really nice loop that I had never heard being used before and decided to play with it.\nAt the breakdown part I used one of the EMU ESI's powerful filters to completely cut out the bass line and just leave the percussion part audible.\nThe sax is my Korg Prophecy, strings and most other instruments are the Supernova II. Piano part is the Yamaha CS1X.\nThis is the only recording of this track that I have.",

            "about": "Orphaned tracks Vol 1 is part of a series of unreleased tracks, lost & found tracks, unfinished ideas etc, that cover a spectrum of electronic music genres.\nListening back now I would have a arranged and mixed some of these differently but in many cases I do not have the original kit or audio parts to return to them.\nMost of the tracks within the series were recorded sometime after 1998.\nI expanded my studio beyond the Roland MC303 which I used extensively between 1996 to 1998. The music contained have been written/recorded between 1998 right up to recent years, so expect quite a difference in both musicality & production values.\nI have mastered the tracks to garner a coherent balance where possible.\nSome pieces I found only have one recording, or a rough mix draft were I planned to go back and work further but never did & then eventually the equipment I used to make the original had become no longer part of my set up.\nMany of these tracks came about during sessions for a particular album but either didn't fit the running time restrictions or just felt a little out of place or the record label felt it did not suit the aesthetic but I still have love for many these.\nOthers came about from a jam with a new piece of equipment and I just hit record. Some are ideas I had but could never develop them further and got left behind.\nI feel a time has come to share these lost moments, ideas, sketches that show various moments of my development as an artist which bring me to where I am today, a somewhat focused creator with more discipline and an aesthetic that I think I can now call my own.\nClick on each track to see a little bit of info on each piece if interested.\nI hope you enjoy these pieces that you can maybe use to make your own playlists.\nMick Chillage\nOct 2021",

Im not super obsessed with the 303 sound but back in the late 80's I was hooked on it and the Acid House music of that period was hugely responsible for my passion with electronic music. Anyway this is the first time I used the MS, Tried to create a very stripped down Chicago jacking sound of the mid to late 80's.",

It was a live jam that I Intended to return and fine tune, but somewhere in the process I lost the recording of the MS20 sequence.\nThis track has a somewhat Berlin School/70's Space music sound.\nThis recording may have a little bit too much overdrive in places for some tastes. Which is an artefact of the MS20's filters and my somewhat enthusiastic approach to the control knobs at the time of the life performance :)",

Being fully aware of this legendary synth I decided to bring it home on the same day.\nWithin a few days of setting up both in my studio, this track emerged. The MS20 producing the most unique sax like tone and playing with its dual filter the sound you hear at the start is just one patch no multi tracking and improvisation, some rumbling of the filters is present at times!\nThe pad and the synth sequence is the mophoX4 & some basic live drum loops and layered filtered drums for some sonic interest.\nRecorded in a day I knew I had made the right choice with these two powerful analogue synths.\nThis is however the only recording I have of \"Mopho & Mini\"",

A few more times in the late 90's I travelled back to LA and often saw the building in the distance as we drove around the sprawling city.\nSo after a visit in late 99' I returned to rainy old Dublin and wrote this short piece and the title just jumped out at me as we were also rapidly approaching the end of the 20th century and heading into a new millennium and I felt the track has a certain futuristic feel.",

So in 2001 we done a special with Focus records boss Claire and some of the artists Tim Koch and Cim also joined in for phone chat.\nThrough that conversation Claire was interested in hearing some of my material, she particularly like this untitled Electro track which I re titled \"Refocus\" which was the new name of her label.",

I'm particularly found of this track that conjures different vast landscapes and times a possible future memories.",

Mixing up his influences effortlessly, Mick sees his production techniques like a reflection of life choices, sudden unexpected changes in path result in new often unimagined sonic adventures.\nAlien drones and mechanical found sounds can mutate into minimalist Techno workouts, wild analogue experimentation can be calmed with orchestral touches and finely tuned sinewave melodies. Often utilising just one patch to create a rich and evolving musical narrative.\nDisc Two is as diverse as the title suggests and lets Mick explore his Ambient expanse with no compromise. Full of majesty and loss in equal measure Mick here explores the humanity/spirituality often lost in electronic music composition and is possibly best listened to in personal headspaces.",

Like the subtlest works by Eno, this one unfolds slowly as its myriad sounds creep up on you.\nMick Chillage returns to the Anodize fold with volume two in his Pixels series of longform neuro-ambient works. Pixels II works the same phantasmic mojo as its predecessor, trading in irruptive gestures that shiver and undulate across an ever-shifting aural environment. Over its near hour-length lifespan, it's become evident that Mr. Chillage has truly earned his stripes as one of ambient music's best contemporary prognosticators, recalling not only classic FAX sides of the 90s era, but pointing the way towards all kinds of bright, impressionistic futures.\nMr. Chillage has already built quite the rep for himself, releasing music across a slew of labels (Fax, Psychonavigation, etc.) and in many different styles. For Anodize, last year's electro-themed release under his The Shape alias was one of his more provocative recordings, and with the Pixels series, he continues reworking a minimalist ambient canvas thanks to a seemingly endless supply of distinctive aural squibs.\nCD's available here:\nanodizesound.bandcamp.com/album/pixels-ii",

            "about": "Anodize is very pleased to present the final captivating volume in Mick Chillage's stellar \"Pixels\" series.\nIn completing this trilogy, it's obvious upon listening to this latest longform work that Mr. Chillage can hold his own as one of the contemporary masters of modern ambient electronica. Across a now dizzying catalog of releases, both solo & in collaboration with many like-minded colleagues, Mick has demonstrated an almost uncanny way with knob, slider, potentiometer, sequencer, trackpad, and mouse. But the device through which he works his alchemy is irrelevant; it's always the talent behind the tool, and Mick's cantilevered soundscapes never fail to engage the imagination.\n\"Pixels III\" is no exception. From twilight reverie to predawn ecstasy, shadow to substance, the good Mr. Chillage has devised an dense world of sound that is as colorfully navigable as those augured by such noted antecedents as Mssrs. Eno, Namlook, Mixmaster Morris and a small gaggle of others. Fine company to keep indeed, but no second, moment, or texture goes wasted; this is a broad artistic statement to not only treasure but to revisit time and again.\ncredits\nreleases 16 October 2015\nWritten, produced and mastered by Michael Gainford at The Igloo, Dublin, Spring 2015.\nEquipment used: Dave Smith Mopho X4, Novation Supernova II. Arranged & mixed in Ableton 9.\nSpecial thanks to Darren and all who support my music.\nSleeve design & imagery: Bold Asterisks.\n©2015 mick chillage ©2015 Anodize\nPre-order the limited CD version direct from:\nanodizesound.bandcamp.com/album/pixels-iii-october",

            "about": "\"Points Of Gradation\" was originally released on Before & After Silence Recordings in Feb 2025\nIn late 2022 I acquired my sisters old acoustic guitar and set about with the intention to firstly experiment with it for some sonic textures that may sit with certain projects. Over sometime I began to develop some themes or compositions within my limited playing ability, however I was quite pleased with the emotions that they appeared to convey.\nDuring this period, naturally I had accumulated various synth based ambient works that covered various themes and moods and I also played some acoustic moments with certain pieces.\nCut to summer of 2023 I now had what felt like the foundation for a new album that included a mix of pure synth based ambient and some with the acoustic guitar taking centre stage & a mix of both approaches.\nI knew this was going to be a bit of leap for me releasing this to the world as I'm mainly known for purely electronic based music with occasional filed recordings and electroacoustic & found sounds.\nHowever, from an artists point of view its always being important for me to grow in someway, take risks, jump genres etc so I decided to complete this collection of pieces and present a new album!

            "about": "Pulsations was born from some experimentations with the Moog Grandmother in early October by just playing around creating various drones, using different oscillator combinations, filtering, envelopes and subtle modulations.\nEach one had the same tuning and was just played at different keys.\nFrom there other polyphonic synths were used to create deeper or more mysterious atmospheres and an emotional sense, switching from light to dark.\nA lot of manipulation of the source material and use of FX and careful mixing and arranging resulted in the 50 minute piece, which I hope gives a sense of otherworldly escapism while listening.\nMarch 2025 \"Pulsations\" got a new extended mix & a 24Bit remaster.",

            "about": "Over the last few years I have been fortunate to be asked to do many remixes for various labels, artists, and friends, many of which saw mainly digital releases and a few which made it onto CD and some of which unfortunately never ended up being released.\nIn some cases where I created an ambient remix of a techno track, I found these often got overlooked somewhat, a problem due to the fact that they ended up in the techno or house sections of Juno or Beatport etc.. I guess my thinking outside of the box in these very much genre specific days was a poor creative decision on my part ?\nBut my true feelings on the art of remix is that the remix should really bring something new to the original track, rather than purely just adding a new rhythm section or stuttering and juggling and filtering the musical elements of the original, so this is what I tried to achieve with these. From a creative aspect I am still extremely happy with these remixes despite their lack of critical or commercial success.\nNow in 2013 I have over 30 remixes on my hard drive and feel that it would be a great time to bring most of these together in two collections.\nVolume two will feature the more upbeat moments which venture from Electro, Techno, House, IDM etc.. Both volumes will feature some previously unreleased remix exclusives.\nOf course none of this would have been possible without the assistance of all the great artists and labels\nwho firstly asked me to remix them and now have given me the freedom to finally release all these remixes myself... So a big thank you to all involved.",

            "about": "Over the last few years I have been fortunate to be asked to do many remixes for various labels, artists, and friends, many of which saw mainly digital releases and a few which made it onto CD and some of which unfortunately never ended up being released.\nIn some cases where I created an ambient remix of a techno track, I found these often got overlooked somewhat, a problem due to the fact that they ended up in the techno or house sections of Juno or Beatport etc.. I guess my thinking outside of the box in these very much genre specific days was a poor creative decision on my part ?\nBut my true feelings on the art of remix is that the remix should really bring something new to the original track, rather than purely just adding a new rhythm section or stuttering and juggling and filtering the musical elements of the original, so this is what I tried to achieve with these. From a creative aspect I am still extremely happy with these remixes despite their lack of critical or commercial success.\nNow in 2013 I have over 30 remixes on my hard drive and feel that it would be a great time to bring most of these together in two collections.\nVolume One of \"Rewired\" will focus on my Ambient/Experimental and Downtempo or Chillout reworks and Volume two will feature the more upbeat moments which venture from Electro, Techno, House, IDM etc.. Both volumes will feature some previously unreleased remix exclusives.\nOf course none of this would have been possible without the assistance of all the great artists and labels\nwho firstly asked me to remix them and now have given me the freedom to finally release all these remixes myself... So a big thank you to all involved.",

            "about": "\"Rise\" is a collection of three improvisational piano based pieces that were first composed in late 2023 & early 2024.\nThe title track \"Rise\" was inspired by an early morning walk on a super crisp December morning. As I left my house and looked across the park the sun was rising and a mist was carpeting the grass as the sun thawed frost that had fallen over night.\nI took a photo as there was something magical about the stillness in the air & how the sun cast shadows of the leafless winter trees across the frosted green.\nShortly after my walk I decided to load up my kit and played around with an improvised passage that became the foundation for \"Rise\"\nI returned to the piece in the New Year to arrange further and add additional musical parts and textures & from this I was inspired some more & \"Reassurance\" came about as I took a break from the arranging of \"Rise\" this new piece seemed to fit well with the themes that had developed although compositionally they both felt very distinct.\nFeb 2024 I was out and about with my Zoom recorder in a local forest and captured some recordings, it also was a very sunny day and beams of light stretched across the forest. I got home and listened to the field recordings and immediately began to play some piano keys over the recordings along with some dramatic ambient tones & strings.\nNaturally this became \"Forest Light\" I now had what I felt like was a new piano based ambient album.\nI hope you enjoy my latest release of Piano based ambient works.\nMick Chillage\nMarch 2025",

            "about": "\"Senescence\" was born from a recent beautiful autumn day.\nThis year the changing colour of the leaves has been a little slower than usual, perhaps due to a milder September & October. As I walked in my local park a week ago I was surprised by a lot of wild flowers still blooming yet a lonely fallen leaf was on the narrow pathway, I took a picture, the striking colours against the aged and broken path inspired me.\nLater that day I was compelled to play some keys, I improvised for about five minutes or so using the Native instruments \"Maverick\" Piano instrument.\nI added some subtle delays and FX and layered a Rhodes at an octave higher to add a little more tonal depth. Over the next few hours I added various analogue synth sounds some musical & others that ended up sounding like leaves spinning as they fall to the ground and others appeared to almost emulate bird song.\nFurther improvised piano were added as the piece progressed, adding bass tones and higher twinkling keys. A mix of Moog, Prophet & MS20 sounds in various ways finished off the track.\nI hope what you hear in this piece can evoke a sense of calm & wonder and emotions that the autumn months can bring.\nMick Chillage October 2020.\nSenescence was given a new extended mix & 24Bit master in March 2025",

            "about": "All proceeds for this album got to Mcmillan Cancer support\nPurchase the album from\ntouched.bandcamp.com/album/sky-gazing\nI am proud to announce my mini album for Touched music.\nTouched music, where Some of the planet's greatest Electronic, Ambient & Modern Classical musicians come together for an amazing cause, all proceeds to Macmillan Cancer Support.\nWhat Touched music say about \"Sky Gazing\"\n“If the last twelve months have left you feeling a bit confused with all the political madness both sides of the pond, there’s one things that’s necessary in order to help you through it all. That’s right, the steady and constant truth that is Touched Music.\nIt’s not all doom & gloom, oh no. This year saw the label hit £50,000 raised for Macmillan Cancer Support and to help us continue forth the latest and final release of 2016 comes from Dublin’s very own Mick Chillage.\n“Sky Gazing” is worthy of repeat audition, doing so will allow you to scrape away at the upper layer of staple chill, ambient & downtempo beats, revealing new beauty which appears each time round.\nThe EP opens with a feeling truly like ‘Ageispolis meets Cocteau Twins and almost fooling you into thinking this is going to be a simple affair. What follows is remarkable work, including a thirteen-minute rendition you could really watch the\nclouds to, rolling undertones paired with moody, low acid-squelches, lovely hi-hats, and even a funky & trippy penultimate piece in the form of ‘Fusion Intrusion’.\nThe final track really feels final and demonstrates how fantastically produced the whole thing is. All the tracks manage to emulate each other but no two truly sound the same, establishing a real flow that will draw you in and put this one straight onto repeat.\"",

            "about": "The title track \"Skywave Transmissions\" was conceived in spring of 2023.\nThe initial sketch had sat on my hard drive through the rest of the year due to my ongoing concussion symptoms.\nAt the beginning of 2024 I decided to return to the track and proceeded with a live digital mix and then with some editing of the track arrived at the thirty minute plus final version.\nI guess this fits in within a certain meditative ambient feel but has certain elements that fit with the concept of the earths natural magnetic field and how science and modern technology has developed methods to use these phenomena as a means of driving communication.\nSkywave refers to the electromagnetic wave reflected or refracted from the ionosphere and propagated in the form of a guided wave between the ionosphere and the Earth's surface. Since the skywave can propagate over large distances, it has been widely used in long-distance communication.\nUpon returning to the track I felt that the piece needed a companion with a slightly darker feel. I set to work on my Moog Grandmother and created various shifting modulated drones with a certain ominous feel & some sequences that could drift in and out that suggest various radio waves bouncing back and fourth through our atmosphere, this track became HF Radiation.\nI hope you enjoy my latest digital long-form album dedicated to our much reliant communication systems & the brilliant minds that created this technology.\nMick Chillage\nMarch 2024",

            "about": "Its been a while since I've created anything that perhaps could\nfit into an often saturated genre \"Space Ambient\"\nLate one night in May of 2020 I created a patch on the Moog Grandmother which I played some improvised passages, one particular section kinda resonated with me, sounding like a musical alert from some lunar craft so I looped that section.\nI turned to the MS20 and turned its dials to find a deep bass drone and then added various patching and modulation settings to change the tone in various ways over time. Another lengthy improvisation was captured with the MS2O that worked in a deep and mysterious way to me, it was late so I saved my session and went to bed.\nThe next day, while in work various parts were floating through my head and I had some mental ideas where to go next. I went through a folder of recorded sounds from various films that I had been building up. I took some machine like sounds which I pitched and manipulated in various ways to suit the sonic back drop I already had. I then added some improvised voice like pads from the Prophet Rev 2 which I had edited to suit the building structure, some more Moog, some more MS20 and more Rev2 by that night I had a total of 23 individual elements that I could play around with and all seemed to work well together.\nThe following day I mixed and arranged pretty much what you hear now in the final mix.\nI hope this track manages to keep your attention as it passes through various sections which hopefully conjures up eerie atmospheres and emotions.\nI also avoided the temptation to use blatantly obvious sound bites from the movies which was very popular in the early to mid 90's and often used as a cheap trick to give a track a certain kudos or make appear deeper than the music actually is.\nTo me \"So far From Home\" sounds like a lonely journey through some of the deepest yet unexplored galaxies with only the sounds of the machines onboard to keep you company.\nOnly you the listener can decide where this piece of music takes you for almost 60 minutes.",

            "about": "CD Originally released on Before & After Silence Recordings.\nIn July of 2020 I released a digital only version of “So Far From Home” it was a return to a “Space Music” style which I’m probably best known for with my release “FAXology”\nThe track was a synergy of both Analogue & Digital synths, some found sounds & sound bites that I had collected over time, I initially built a foundation of various hums/drones manipulated machine-like sounds etc and then added more musical themes that gave a sense of being transported through deep space with only the mechanical & electronic sounds of the hi tech craft to keep you company.\nI felt it was important to convey some varying emotional moods; as on this journey you encounter various majestic phenomena with a sense of wonder with moments of loneliness and uncertainty as you venture further out into the vastness of uncharted space.\nThree distinct movements morph & shift during its fifty five minute duration.\n“So Far From Home” was quite a popular digital release and I had some requests about a CD release at some point. I returned to the track in early jan of 2022 and after composing the accompanying track “Dreams Of Our Blue Planet'' in Dec of 2021, Which I felt like it belonged within the same sonic universe.\nFor the CD release I went back and reworked the mix, giving some sounds more prominence and expanding the stereo mIx, additional automated panning on certain sounds along with some subtle tweaks to the arrangement and FX enhancement, which introduces some unheard tones from the original synth experimentation sessions.\nI am now delighted to present this new CD Mix version of “So Far From Home” along with a brand new track “Dreams Of Our Blue Planet” which clocks in at just over twenty minutes with an emotive and deeply atmospheric aesthetic.\nMick Chillage Feb 2022",

            "about": "Temporal Cities was written & recorded in late Autumn of 2022.\nInitially inspired by a rather wild and experimental patch that I had created on my MS20 mini that is prominent within the first twelve minutes of the title track.\nIt's rather angular and morphing tones and shards of noise reminded me of architecture that can be often brutal & sleek, other synths merge that create a sense of shifting shapes and structure, almost like a cities passing skyline as you cruise on a nearby freeway and observe the decaying and newly built structures.\nAs the track progresses there is a a rather significant mood and tonal change, a lighter more melodic feel with a minimalistic slomo bass heavy groove but with elements of the first part are echoed deep within the mix and return again in full to close the track.\nAs my ideas came together I decided that I wanted to create something that merged Ambience and rhythmic structures. I worked solidly on the three main tracks over the space of a week or so.\nOverall I feel there's a connected theme, although each piece has its own identity. I've also included an Alt version of \"Hypnotides\" along with an Ambient mix of \"Oblique Horizons\" which gives this album a total running time of approximately ninety five minutes of music.",

            "about": "\"The Function Of Life\" was written & recorded in early summer of 2020. It was never my soul intention to create a more \"space like\" ambient body of work. The three rather longish pieces were formed within about two weeks and seemed to have a relationship or connection in some way.\nI became conscious of their somewhat ethereal or other worldly trajectory but was also mindful to try to avoid being heavy handed with over used \"Space Ambient\" cliche's, a challenge indeed!\nI tried to focus on the relationship of the sonic canvas and the movement of musical ideas that have a certain compositional value rather than just a strong sonic aesthetic or technical complexity that may not warrant multiple listens.\nI hope i have succeeded in creating something that is both pure sonic escapism yet hasn't forgot to touch the various emotional sides of the listener.\nThe album was released through Fantasy Enhancing records in early autumn of 2020. It seemed to please fans of my FAXology album and other Fax artists and in some ways I do see it as perhaps a sequel to my debut on the influential label.\nMick Chillage Nov 2020",

I retuned to \"the Order Of The Heavens\" in early 2025 and added additional sounds & felt a second piece was needed to accompany the first piece.\nThe second pieces foundation was created in an evenings session and matched the dark space aesthetics of the first.\nLate summer of 2025 I went back and fine tuned both pieces & felt the album was ready for release.\nI hope you enjoy this new chapter of sonic explorations of somewhat darker heavenly themes.\nMick Chillage\nOctober 2025",

            "about": "Tides Of Melancholy” will be released just on the first anniversary of Before & After Silence Recordings in early January 2022 and it will be the sixth CD on the label. The album consists of five Ambient pieces of varying lengths, three of which were composed in 2021.\nThe three pieces I composed in 2021 seemed to fit within a particular emotive narrative and sonic aesthetic. I saw a connection with the piece “Footsteps In Fog '' track three which I had written after the passing of Harold Budd in 2020, strangely at the time of writing the piece I felt it could possibly be part of an album at some point.\nTrack one “Submerged Cathedrals” came about rather quickly, some sonic experimentation led me to an almost human-like tonal quality that I played on the keys. This inspired me, adding more keys, piano, strings and deeper synths. The track conveys a mournful feel, like a once beautiful structure that is vividly remembered but is now lost forever in deep murky waters and its haunting sentiments sets the tone of the album.\nTrack Two “One Sanguine Day” seems to shift between a certain sombre tone and shifts with moments that shimmer with light and a sense of hope.\nThe title track “Tides Of Melancholy” feels like a soundtrack to a series of filmic snapshots from deep within a melancholic state of mind as it slowly builds and shifts to a layered tapestry of emotive tone and colour.\nThe closing-piece “Arc Of Light” was originally Written and recorded in late 2019. It’s somewhat Electro-Acoustic, Neoclassical and subtle synthesised elements with the eventual emergence of a jazz influenced rhythm and bass combo lifts the track almost as if the melancholic state of mind Has subsided and finishes the theme and concept of the album\nIn a fitting way.\nMick Chillage",

            "about": "Written and recored in early Jan 2020.\n\"Time Lapsed Skies\"Explores the relationship between various monophonic drones created with the Korg MS20 Mini and subtle improvised synth leads and polyphonic keys and pads courtesy of the Prophet Rev2.\nA total of eight individual audio tracks where used along with some additional digital FX, the track was arranged on the fly and recorded.\nThis live arrangement and mix was then edited further to make these minimal elements work over the almost 60 minute duration.\nIdeally listened to with low to medium volume in a quiet low distraction environment. Look to the skies..\nWritten and recorded by Michael Gainford at the Igloo Dublin Jan 2020.\nI revisited the track in 2024 and gave it a new mix.\nI fixed some background noise that came from some audio bleeding of my MS20 mini with some EQ, Fixing a strange audio pop that was part of the Prophet Rev2's Envelope filter where it was a little too loud and sounded more like a distortion rather than a snapping filter attack at certain points.\nAlso, some mix levels, subtle arrangement changes and a new master in 24bit.\nmastered by Michael Gainford\nPhoto: Michael Gainford.",

            "about": "Early August 2022 I drove out to a pretty remote part of the Dublin mountains to hopefully catch a glimpse of the perseid meteor shower which was at its peak. I was fortunate to see a few meteors within an hour or so of darkness and was happy to return home after experiencing this wonderful galactic phenomena.\nThe following day I was somewhat inspired & began to work on \"Trail Of Stars\" which clocks in at just over 25 minutes, its somewhat dark yet celestial and other worldly feel led me to its sort obvious but fitting title.\nA few days later the star struck mood was still lingering and I felt I needed a companion of some sort to the title track, I set to work with my Prophet and Moog Grandmother along with some field recordings and created the first seven minutes of \"Cosmica Sidera\" In early September I returned to the track and extended it which feels like another movement that is a little more restrained yet deeper in atmosphere.",

            "about": "Transitions was originally released in 2012 as a bandcamp only\nrelease, showcasing my various Techno & House music moods\nover the years.\nSometime after its release on bandcamp a record label showed some interest in a couple of the Techno tracks. The label at the time was looking to put the tracks out as a 12\" vinyl release. They requested that I removed the tracks, so i decided to withdraw the whole release rather than the few tracks.\nAfter some delays and some issues, the label was forced to close & the tracks never got released on vinyl as planned.\nSo in recent times I've had some requests to make the\n\"Transitions\" album available again. The tracks within the album are varying in genre and some date back to the early naughties so listening back now I hear things that I would definitely do differently but I still like the character & charm of these works.\nThe track \"Alive With Wires\" with its rather strong Electro flavours ended up as part of the \"Waveshape Fiction\" album a few years ago under my Electro alias \"The Shape\"\nThe album has now being presented in its original form but remastered by myself in March 2020.\nI hope you enjoy my early take on Techno, House, Electro etc.",

            "about": "End of 2025 saw the release of one of the first long form ambient works from myself in sometime in the form of \"ULF: 01\" Untitled Long Form. By numbering this piece I was hopeful that maybe some more works in this vein would emerge at some point.\nBeginning of 2026 I sat down to experiment with just some patch creation and I had no real intention/concept of any kind in mind. The introduction layer was laid down and I began to experiment with it building on top of it with further elements, I arrived with what I felt maybe the bones of a new track as I spent some time into the early hours jamming with the ideas and letting them loop endlessly and making mental notes of how I might arrange and mix later.\nThe following day I awoke with the piece looping in my head and I knew that I needed to get to work on the mix and arrangement. By the end of the day the track was arranged and mixed.\nThis felt like a worthy sequel to ULF: 01\nI hope you enjoy this second long form sonic exploration in the ULF series.\nMick Chillage Febuary 2026",

            "about": "Its been a while since have worked on or released a long form ambient track/album. There have been some longish pieces that featured on some recent releases but none have been over forty minutes!\nIn early November I began to experiment with some patches I had created on my beloved Prophet Rev2, one in particular had a rather expansive sonic depth with super low bases when certain filter envelopes were tweaked.\nThis sound is performed as the opening passage and continues as the main foundation of the piece, played polyphonically were the low, mid & high keys are utilised which results in rumbling lows, pleasant mids and at times searing highs.\nThis passage seemed to inspire me on an almost instinctive level as I worked, new additional elements seemed to be chosen and edited & played to fit with ease.\nI spent a few days getting the arrangement and mix to work the elements as a long form track. I now had something that appeared to be darkly mysterious and foreboding yet as the piece progressed it introduces a shift of mood to hopefulness or enlightened senses & back again to the dark aesthetic it began with.\nThe last part of the creative process was creating a fitting title,\nI struggled with this due the shifting moods and overall feel of the track. Its working title was simply \"Untitled Long Form\". I eventually settled on the abbreviated ULF: 0I, I feel this keeps its mysterious side and leaves the listener more room to interpret the track however they wish and maybe it leaves it open to a series of ULF tracks in the future?",

            "about": "\"Undercurrents\" was created in mid summer of 2024 with the first track, when I finished the piece I was curious about certain sonic elements, the sustained and slightly modulated high pitched drone, the super low ominous bass that you feel as much as you hear and the sweeping & rising modulated synth FX/atmo part. What if these became the foundations of an album and continued to carry new pieces as they emerged in sequence?\n\"Part 2\" was a piece of improvised ambience that had been sitting on my hard drive since spring and one that I was very happy with, I dropped it into the project and mixed it with the elements from the above mentioned sounds & it just clicked into place, the next two works were conceived on top of the original foundations/undercurrents which worked as a nice source of inspiration.\nDedicated to the memory of Cory Mills\nThank you for your friendship & for sharing so many wonderful images.",

            "about": "“Urban Nature” was recorded in late spring/early summer of 2021\nand was inspired by a wonderful section of wild land known as the\n“The River Dodder Valley Park” that sits between two urban locations near my home. The Dodder river springs from the Dublin mountains, the park is full of wildlife and has a path that runs through it for about 5km, which has recently been expanded.\nI’ve always found it fascinating that this thriving natural habitat sits near dual carriageways, the M50 motorway, its flyovers, local shopping centres and even a cement plant nearby. There's a waterfall and a weir and remnants of the old canal system that led from the old developing Tallaght village to the heart of Dublin's city centre.\nSo armed with my Zoom portable recorder I gathered lots of various recordings, nature and urban sounds and they inspired me to improvise over these elements using keys, mainly virtual piano and subtle synths & effects etc. The music would sit along the lines of modern/minimal classical and perhaps inspired by Harold Budd, Brian Eno etc.\nI tried to capture certain locations along this path with certain sonic aesthetics. Part 3 for example was inspired by a large electrical pylon that sits close to the river bank and its heavy cables span across the river. Birds nest nearby and I can imagine the possible electrical interference that the various animals may hear or feel so the piano part modulates and gets almost lost at times with a slightly unsettling level of interference & unnatural noise.\nUltimately I created the album to be listened to in one sitting, trying to capture a soundtrack to the 5-6km walk with the different sounds and feelings you may gather from these polar opposite environments coexisting, so the CD is mixed as one track but each piece is easily identifiable as they start and end.\nThe individual tracks are offered digitally and come with the purchase of the CD at bandcamp.\nThe album is dedicated to the memory of Steve Brown.\nMick Chillage\nApril 2022",

            "about": "A man of prolific means and invention to match, Mick Chillage is one of those names virtually synonymous with deep, high-quality, far-reaching electronic music, an artist who easily glides between modes of ambience and rhythmic facility with a finely-honed, agile grace. His return to the Carpe Sonum fold is no less dramatic. The lengthy pieces adorning this latest work allow the artist’s usual stately pace to run free and allow his gradually dawning motifs room to pulse and breathe; ten minutes of a typical Chillage piece often exposes more ideas per second than other artist’s whole volumes. The dramatis analogae of “Echoes of Perception” takes in a veritable smorgasbord of synths, modules, pads, sequencers, bass, and perambulating ghost-voices that together paint a unearthly picture teeming with all sorts of wonderfully devised gossamer and broad, electronic gimcrackery. His many collaborations with Lee Norris as Autumn of Communion seemed to have rubbed off on this one, as Chillage fairly revels in a bubbling tableau of starshine beats, spaced-out shimmer, and supple beds of pillowly-soft rhythmatix. “A Recollection of Distant Environments” finds him channelling the ever-present (and reverential) Namlookisms of yore but skewed through a Berlin school filter of chocolate-coated sequencers, and the kind of beat structure so beloved of IDMers from Boards of Canada to Black Dog, further reincarnated from late 90s imprints such as n5MD, De:focus, and Rephlex. Sweet licorice labyrinths of sonic perambula to get all twisty in.",

            "about": "Variants of Perception was originally released on Carpe Sonum Records in Spring of 2022.\nComprising of tracks recorded between 2019 & 2020 the album sees me returning to my trademark mixture of deep Ambient tones & atmospheres with a mix of various electronic music influences with moments of Intricate IDM beats, Dub & downtempo breakbeat etc but with a generous sprinkling of improvised leads and emotive melodic flourishes.\nResulting in a rather personal exploration of what it is to be human and triggers memories, feelings & emotions through contemporary & sometimes experimental electronic sound.\nWhat the label says:\nA man of prolific means and invention to match, Mick Chillage is one of those names virtually synonymous with deep, high-quality, far-reaching electronic music, an artist who easily glides between modes of ambience and rhythmic facility with a finely-honed, agile grace. His return to the Carpe Sonum fold is no less dramatic. The lengthy pieces adorning this latest work allow the artist’s usual stately pace to run free and allow his gradually dawning motifs room to pulse and breathe; ten minutes of a typical Chillage piece often exposes more ideas per second than other artist’s whole volumes. The dramatis analogae of “Echoes of Perception” takes in a veritable smorgasbord of synths, modules, pads, sequencers, bass, and perambulating ghost-voices that together paint a unearthly picture teeming with all sorts of wonderfully devised gossamer and broad, electronic gimcrackery. His many collaborations with Lee Norris as Autumn of Communion seemed to have rubbed off on this one, as Chillage fairly revels in a bubbling tableau of starshine beats, spaced-out shimmer, and supple beds of pillowly-soft rhythmatix. “A Recollection of Distant Environments” finds him channelling the ever-present (and reverential) Namlookisms of yore but skewed through a Berlin school filter of chocolate-coated sequencers, and the kind of beat structure so beloved of IDMers from Boards of Canada to Black Dog, further reincarnated from late 90s imprints such as n5MD, De:focus, and Rephlex. Sweet licorice labyrinths of sonic perambula to get all twisty in.",

            "about": "\"Voice of the Ancients\" was born from a rather simple yet inspiring lead sound I created on the Moog Grandmother, the first few notes I played on the keys with this sound became the foundation of the track.\nThe sound is played in two separate audio elements, the second part has the higher octave improv lead part which I chopped up and placed at various points.\nAs these parts looped around I could hear a human voice accompanying these synth parts in my head. I grabbed my portable zoom recorder and with my headphones I tried my best to perform some vocal textures along with what I had already played. Out of the two minutes or so of various vocal passes I found one that appeared to work, I sampled it and treated in various ways and played it on the keys at different octaves, I was surprised how natural it sounded to my ears and I moved forward with the track.\nProgrammed Drums and percussive parts plus other found sounds, further Moog sounds were created until I had a structure that I could work with.\nUnintentionally I feel I created perhaps something that harks back to an era of the early 90's Ambient that fused subtle ethnic elements with a strong FAX records influence in particular.\nWritten and recorded between the 16th/18th of November 2022.\nEquipment used:\nMoog Grandmother mono synth [overdubbed]\nMy voice\nZoom Z1 portable recorder.\nAbleton Live 10 for audio arranging, digital treatments and FX.\nVirtual 808 style drum kit.",

            "about": "Water Air Light was compiled & conceived in late July 2022.\nThe tracks contained were created with a rather large time space between them.\nTrack 1 \"The Cycle of Water\" was written and recorded in late Autumn of 2021. Inspired by a domestic appliance at my home, I recorded the water sounds and mechanical elements and then found particular moments within these and looped and manipulated, various synths formed a foundation and the additional improvised leads and piano add a further organic feel to the track.\nTrack 2 \"Dreams Of Light\" was composed in late January of 2022 and was inspired by the creeping extending duration of daylight that slowly begins at this time of year in the southern Hemisphere.\nTrack 3 is an alternative take of \"Intervals Of light\" released in 2019 where I manipulated and rearranged the source sounds and introduced some new synth parts & additional FX to create a more ethereal and subtle take on the original.\nThis version was created end of July 2022.\nOverall the album has a fairly earthy/emotive feel and the title just seemed to sit with the sonic themes.",

            "about": "What the label Anodize say:\nArch-texturologist Mick Chillage sidesteps ambient phraseology to present on Anodize his new contemporary electro project, The Shape, every bit as thrilling and energizing as Dopplereffekt, John Carpenter & Alan Howarth, Mr. Velcro Fastener and Anthony Rother. Unlike his colleagues, Chillage manages to tweak the formula a turn or two, resulting in some nimble synth parabolas riding atop steely, corkscrew rhythms.\nIrish electronic musician Chillage should be no stranger to followers of Anodize. His presence has not only graced the label via last year's stunning Autumn of Communion 2 project (in collaboration with Lee Anthony Norris), but also this month's excellent ambient travelogue \"Pixels\", already sold out and now the stuff of collectors' shelves and fortunate enthusiasts worldwide.\nThe Shape is a unique work in Chillage's canon, however, displaying a markedly different musical persona, one wholly enamored with the taut percussive vortices of classic electro. Where others bow mercilessly to the tyranny of the beat, Chillage one-ups the game: the grand and grimy cinema audio verité of Carpenter and Howarth's synth fantasias loom large in Chillage's visor, but uninterested in mere copyism, The Shape gnarls his vintage electronics into a whiplash frenzy bent to its own pretzel logic.",

            "about": "Footsteps in Fog was created shortly after the passing of the American minimalist composer Harold Budd in December 2020. Harold's music was a huge influence on myself and so many others, his music touched the soul and stirred the senses with his less is more and improvisational approach where every note, sustain & silence played an equal part in creating a haunting stillness which was deeply poignant and emotive.\nHarold's unique compositions like many of the greats will continue to resonate with music lovers in years to come.\nWhile \"Footsteps In The Fog\" is certainly inspired by Harold's legacy I also see it as a reflection on the year that was 2020 and is dedicated to the other great artists that left us this year and also for anyone that found 2020 a personally challenging one.\nOriginally the track was a five minute piece, on the 22nd of December I returned to it and added additional sonic elements and rearranged and mixed it into what is now just over nine minutes.\nI hope you enjoy it.\nMick Chillage 2020",
