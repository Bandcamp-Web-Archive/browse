            "about": "LAIKA WORLD is a collaborative album by Aidan Baker, Jack Chuter, and Ryan Durfee, created in tribute to Laika, the Soviet space dog who became the first animal to orbit Earth aboard Sputnik 2 on November 3, 1957.\nThe album is a sonic blend of diverse influences, including Dean Hurley, SpaceGhostPurrp, Starflyer 59, Emeralds, Flying Saucer Attack, painter Morris Graves, and the films of Renee Harmon and Takeshi Kitano. Birdsong detonates from within sweeps of reverbed guitar, synthesiser and hypnagogic vocal spill, while frenetic drums keep an intermittent sense of time.\nIdeal for those who enjoy late-night conversations and the vivid dreams that follow.\nLimited cassette available from Cruel Nature Recordings:\ncruelnaturerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/laika-world",

            "about": "In 2023, Aidan Baker (Nadja, Tavare), Daron Beck (Pinkish Black), and Tim Wyskida (Khanate, Blind Idiot God, Insect Ark) came together through Baker’s Trio Not Trio series for Gizeh Records—an experiment in presence and distance. Two musicians met in Berlin for a live, improvised session; a third joined from another part of the world, layering sound and response from afar. What emerged blurred the line between physical space and shared intention, finding new textures in the space between.\nTheir contribution, \"Trzecia,\" became one of the most resonant works in the series—a convergence of weight, tone, and atmosphere that felt both immediate and remote, human and spectral. The trio soon began work on a second recording using the same process, extending the conversation they had begun. Before the final mixes could be completed, Daron Beck sadly passed away.\n\"Trzecia (Drugi)\" gathers fragments from those later sessions that trace the contours of what might have been, and what still remains. It stands as both continuation and memorial, a quiet offering to Beck’s enduring presence within the sound.\nReleased as a limited edition cassette from Cruel Nature Recordings:\ncruelnaturerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/trzecia-drugi\nAnd an even more limited edition lathe-cut 7\" from Skew Note:\nskewnote.bandcamp.com/album/trzecia-drugi\nRecorded in Berlin and Austin in 2024\nTim Wyskida plays Canopus Drums\nArtwork 'Elysian Doorway' by Derek R.
